I'm a fan of Paul Bloom as a thinker and podcast guest, but I didn't get much out of this book. I couldn't decide whether it had the wrong focus or whether it lacked any focus at all. Regardless, I definitely don't feel like I understand how pleasure works. A more accurate title would have been "Musings on essentialism".
