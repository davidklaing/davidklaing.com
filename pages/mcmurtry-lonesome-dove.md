The best novel I've read in years. I had never read a Western before, but I had heard that people get obsessed with this one, and I see why. McMurtry's masterful use of [free indirect style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech) allows you to fully inhabit the minds of each of his characters. Finishing the book is like saying goodbye to your friends. It's rare for a book to make me cry or laugh, and Lonesome Dove made me do both.
