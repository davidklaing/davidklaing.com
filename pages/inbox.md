- Information is undervalued
- Invest time in assets that can't be bought
- Add a dash of evil to avoid moral smugness
- Write to create intrinsic value for yourself
    - Creating intrinsic value for others creates instrumental value for yourself, but if your mindset is that you're maximizing that, you'll go far past the point of diminishing returns for your own intrinsic value. In almost all cases, it's simpler to just get to that point of diminishing returns and then publish. At that point, the value for others will not be maximized, but it will be non-zero. So you're getting tons of intrinsic value and a dash of instrumental value
    - Another way to put this would be: write your thing until it's maximially valuable to you even if nobody else were to ever read it. But then publish it so that people can. Crucially, *don't* go further than that except in rare cases. The effort of making it maximizing value *to others* is far, far greater than the effort of maximizing value to you. This is all extremely related to the 'aesthetic bullseye'.
