"Striving" play is play that is done not for the experience of achieving a particular goal, but for the experience of striving toward that goal. When I sit down to play chess, I don't particularly care whether I'm going to win; I'm just in it for the pleasure of *trying* to win.

Contrast with <a id="achievement-play" class="internal-link" href="/achievement-play/">achievement play</a>.
