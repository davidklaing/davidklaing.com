I maintain this website for four main reasons:

1. To share ideas that I think are valuable and underappreciated, usually in the form of short <a id="essays" class="internal-link" href="/essays/">essays</a>.
2. To use writing as a means for thinking and learning. Mostly this happens in my <a id="notes" class="internal-link" href="/notes/">notes</a>, which are unpolished and written mostly for myself.
3. To keep track of things that I think my future self will be interested in. This means tracking <a id="books" class="internal-link" href="/books-ive-read/">my reading</a> and writing <a id="reviews" class="internal-link" href="/reviews/">reviews</a> and <a id="yearly-retrospectives" class="internal-link" href="/yearly-retrospectives/">yearly retrospectives</a>.
3. To make it easier for my future friends to find me. If you think you might be one of them, please say hello! The best way to reach me is by sending a direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidklaing). You can also stay in touch by <a id="subscribe" class="internal-link" href="/subscribe/">subscribing</a> for email updates.
