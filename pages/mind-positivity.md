Self-love messaging generally focuses on the body, but surely there are many people (like me) who are more insecure about their minds. Imagine the rallying cries of a mind positivity movement:

- You are smart!
- You are funny!
- You are creative!
- You are insightful!

The metaphor can be extended further:

- Excessive studying as a 'reading disorder'
- Shitposting as taking no-filter mind-selfies
- faux-casualness wrt punctuation & capitalization as #iWokeUpLikeThis
- Lurkers as people who are too ashamed of their physique to show themselves at the gym
- Universities, Twitter, Great Books as things that promote unrealistic intelligence standards
- The Theory of Multiple Intelligences as the Dove Real Beauty Campaign (in terms of moral messaging)
- Second-brainism as calorie-counting (in terms of incessant metacognition about what you're consuming)
- High-end online courses as Pelotonâ€”embarrassingly bougie, probably unnecessary, but might actually work
- Mind-dysmorphia: the unshakeable belief that some part of your mind is inadequate (otherwise known as impostor syndrome)
