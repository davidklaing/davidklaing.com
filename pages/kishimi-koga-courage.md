I picked this book up because I'd seen people praise it on Twitter. Otherwise I wasn't too sure what I was getting into. It turns out that the authors' goal was to be for Alfred Adler what Plato was to Socrates. I'm not sure they succeed, or whether the attempt is particularly necessary. If you want to learn about Alfred Adler or his work, you'd probably be better served by reading Wikipedia. This book scatters ~50 pages worth of information across 300 pages of dialogue, most of which comes across as fairly contrived. I was pretty bored by the end, and found that most of the arguments were either obvious or unconvincing.
