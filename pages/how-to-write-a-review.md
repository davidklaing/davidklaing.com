It's not obvious how best to review a book, course, product, or whatever. To make my reviews consistently valuable, I aspire to roughly follow this procedure: 

1. Say why I decided to use the thing. This helps my reader compare the goals I had with the goals they have.
2. Describe my knowledge or experience with the appropriate reference class for the thing. E.g. if I'm reviewing a book on a particular period of history, I should say whether this is the first book I've read on the topic or the tenth.
3. Describe the thing's strengthsâ€”what I liked about it or learned from it.
4. Note any salient flaws.
5. Describe the context in which I would recommend the thing.

This reviewing procedure is a modified version of what A. Jesse Jiryu Davis recommends in his post, [Write An Excellent Programming Blog](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/).
