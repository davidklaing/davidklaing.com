"Achievement" play is play that is done for the experience of achieving a particular goal, rather than for the experience of merely striving toward it. For example, a professional poker player doesn't just play for a good time; they play for the money.

Contrast with <a id="striving-play" class="internal-link" href="/striving-play/">striving play</a>.
