I tore through this book in about three days. It's pretty much perfect. I've read _The Iliad_ three times, and Miller's telling of the story is unquestionably more beautiful and poignant than Homer's. It's not just that she told it through the lens of the most interesting relationshipâ€”although this makes the tragedy all the more devastating. It's also that every word in the book seems perfectly chosen. Every paragraph is like a painting. The book is exactly as long as it should be, but still I wanted it to go on longer.
