I decided to read this book because I was blown away by Graeber's 2018 book, _<a id="graeber-bullshit-jobs" class="internal-link" href="/graeber-bullshit-jobs/">Bullshit Jobs</a>_. _Debt_ is a more ambitious book, and perhaps a bit too ambitious. It aims to do several things: criticize capitalism, tell a sweeping history of debt, and debunk myths about the origins of money. It achieves all these things, but not with much narrative cohesion. As a result, throughout the long middle section (chapters 3-11) I lost the thread of what Graeber was trying to express.

I kept thinking about the narrative structure of The Last Dance, the Netflix documentary series about Michael Jordan and the '98 season of the Chicago Bulls: each episode told part of the story of the '98 season, and part of the broad history that led up to it. As a viewer, you learn all about the history, but you are constantly reminded of its relevance to the main story. _Debt_ would have been more accessible if Graeber had alternated between telling the 5,000-year history of debt and, say, explaining the 2008 financial crisis, or at least trying to connect the history back to present-day concerns.

If you read this book, I'd recommend reading it in this order:

- Chapters 1 and 2
- Chapter 12
- Afterword
- Chapters 3-11
