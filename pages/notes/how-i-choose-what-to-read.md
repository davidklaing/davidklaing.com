A useful distinction is between a *book* and a *reading*. A book is a static artifact: an author wrote and published a sequence of words on such-and-such date. A reading is an experience of interacting with a particular book. A reading is partially defined by the book in question, but it's also defined by many other factors, such as:

- The medium in which you read the book (audio, electronic, paper)
- Your purpose for reading the book (entertainment, education, comfort, etc)
- The manner in which you read the book (linearly vs nonlinearly, carefully vs casually, sampling vs consuming fully)
- Whether you have a natural outlet to discuss the book with others
- What else you've read previously, both recently and in the distant past
- What is currently happening in your life

Rather than trying to identify the best possible books, I try to identify the best possible readings. In my experience, good readings have one or more of the following qualities:

- **The medium is appropriate for the material.** I consume most narrative by audioâ€”this includes novels, memoirs, biographies, and some history. I consume most informational nonfiction by Kindle, because it's distraction-free but easy to save highlights, which I can later turn into flashcards.
- **My closest friends have read the book before, or are reading it currently.** This makes it way easier to have deep discussions about the book, which makes for a substantially higher-quality reading. In fact, this discussability factor can reliably produce a high-quality reading even out of a low-quality book, since you can get tons of pleasure and insight from conversations about _why_ the book is bad.
- **The book has at least one clear connection to something that is meaningful to me.** This can mean a lot of things. Maybe it's that the book is related to a hobby I'm exploring, or that it influenced the author of another book I loved. The point is that the more such connections I can make, and the stronger they are, the better I expect the reading to be.

To find books and contexts that reliably produce good readings, I use three tactics:

1. Maintain a <a id="how-i-maintain-my-want-to-read-list" class="internal-link" href="/how-i-maintain-my-want-to-read-list/">contextually rich want-to-read list</a>.
2. Assemble project-specific reading lists.
3. Participate in one or more reading groups, with a preference for groups that meet chapter-by-chapter rather than book-by-book. (See James Somers' post, [Most book clubs are doing it wrong](https://jsomers.net/blog/book-clubs).)
