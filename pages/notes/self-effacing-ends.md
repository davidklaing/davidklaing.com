A self-effacing end is one that can't be achieved by aiming directly at it.

Examples:

- Happiness. The happiest people seem to be those who are focused on other thingsâ€”relationships, meaningful work, etc. They don't seem to spend much time thinking about how to become happier.
- Prestige. If you focus directly on earning prestige, you will likely be seen as manipulative or self-absorbed. The most prestigious people tend to become so through achievements or genuine good qualities.
