A context switch occurs any time you are compelled to make a decision that is outside your current context. If you are trying to do focused work—say, reading, writing, or coding—and suddenly you have to choose a new song to listen to, or decide whether to respond to a message, you've just undergone a context switch. Focusing well is a matter of minimizing the frequency, unpredictability, and scale of out-of-context decisions. To do this, you should:

- Remove auditory distraction. If you have access to a totally silent environment, that works best. Alternatively, you can mask unpredictable sounds by listening to a playlist or looping audio track that supports focus and does not require active monitoring. For example, listen to [brain.fm](brain.fm), [lofi hip hop radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A), or [Ravenclaw common room](https://harry-potter-sounds.ambient-mixer.com/ravenclaw-common-room). The worst thing to do is choose your own music on Spotify.
- Remove visual distraction. Work in an environment that is visually static—e.g. an indoor room with nobody in it, facing away from the window. If there's a lot of movement in your visual field, your eyes will naturally be drawn to it. Also, remove objects that prompt use—like your phone, or a bag of snacks—as well as objects that prompt feelings of frustration or stress—like dirty laundry, unprocessed garbage, etc.
- Remove physical distraction. Be as comfortable as possible. When choosing earphones, reading glasses, a chair, a desk, etc, prioritize comfort over almost everything else.
- Remove social distraction. Be alone if you can. Turn off notifications. Log out of Slack, Messenger, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.
