A maieutic end is an end of acquiring another end.

Examples:

- Searching for your life's purpose. You want a grand goal to pursue; you just don't know what that goal is yet, so your current goal is to discover it.
- Falling in love. Many people who are not in love wish they were. But to be in love isn't an end in itself; once you're in love, you simply love the person you're in love with.
- Cultivating an interest in a subject. E.g. I'm currently not very interested in math or history, but I wish I were.
