I recently read Madeline Miller's book, <a id="miller-song-of-achilles" class="internal-link" href="/miller-song-of-achilles/">The Song of Achilles</a>, which is a retelling of the story of Achilles and the Trojan war from the perspective of Patroclus, Achilles' male lover. I thought the book was incredible, so I raved about it to several friends. One of them took me up on the recommendation and read the book, but he thought it was only okay. When we discussed it, I learned that, unlike me, my friend had never read The Iliad and was unfamiliar with the story that The Song of Achilles was adapting. We both read the same book, but had very different experiences.

A useful distinction is between a *book* and a *reading*. A book is a static artifact: an author wrote and published a sequence of words on such-and-such date. A reading is an experience of interacting with a particular book. A reading is partially defined by the book in question, but it's also defined by many other factors, such as:

- The medium in which you read the book (audio, electronic, paper)
- Your purpose for reading the book (entertainment, education, comfort, etc)
- The manner in which you read the book (linearly vs nonlinearly, carefully vs casually, sampling vs consuming fully)
- Whether you have a natural outlet to discuss the book with others
- What else you've read previously, both recently and in the distant past
- What is currently happening in your life

Rather than trying to identify the best possible books, I try to identify the best possible readings. Practically, this means I use one of the following strategies:

- Pick a book that is connected to 


3. Maintaining a contextually rich want-to-read list.
4. Assembling project-specific reading lists.


I usually have three to five books on the go at a time, in the following categories:

1. A novel, memoir, biography, or casual lecture series, usually consumed for ~2 hours a day by audio while snacking, doing chores, or out walking. For these books, I usually listen from start to finish, in order, and take very few notes, if any.
2. Two-to-three informational nonfiction books that are tied to a medium-term learning project. I read these by Kindle, make extensive highlights, and jump around a lot, both within and between books.
3. A book for each of the two book clubs I'm in. One of these clubs is with my team at work; we read a chapter a week of a nonfiction book that is relevant to work. The other club is just for fun, and most of the time we read novels. For both clubs, I usually read on Kindle so that I can make highlights, which make it easier for me to contribute meaningfully to discussions.
