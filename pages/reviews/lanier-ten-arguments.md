I decided to read this book after reading Simon Dedeo's reflections on it in his post, [The 11th Reason to Delete your Social Media Account: the Algorithm will Find You](http://simondedeo.com/?p=705).

I found the book surprisingly persuasive. I expected it to contain a bunch of common-sense arguments and references to unreplicated studiesâ€”the kind of thing you'd expect from, maybe, a journalist writing on this topic. What I didn't realize is that Jaron Lanier has been deeply immersed in the tech world for a long time and really knows what he's talking about. In this book, he argues mainly from philosophical and spiritual perspectives. To get a sense of his stance, I recommend watching [this 20-minute interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc_Jq42Og7Q&t=54s&ab_channel=Channel4News). His interview with Ezra Klein is also good.

I finished the book a few weeks ago and still haven't deleted any of my social media accounts, but I'm considering it. I haven't really used Facebook or Instagram in a long time, but at times over the past several years I've been a big-time Twitter addict. I'm conflicted about Twitter. On the one hand, it's a great way to increase serendipity, both for personal relationships and for my career. On the other hand, it's hard to use in a way that feels healthy.
