A very cool book that is generally enjoyable, but has some drawbacks:

- A lot of the worldbuilding felt like it was told rather than shown.
- I can't say I particularly cared about any of the characters, or about any of the relationships between them. I find it hard to really love a novel if this element is missing.
- I'm not sure it's fair to evaluate this book on its own since it's so clearly the first in a series, but I don't think it quite succeeds as a standalone story, since it opens so many parentheses that won't be closed until the later books.

I listened to the Luke Daniels audiobook and found his narration a bit grating, so this probably biased me against the book a bit. That being said, all in all I found the story inspiring and imaginative.
