This was my first Murakami novel. My main impression was: damn, this guy can't stop thinking about drinks. I kid you not, in the span of 20 pages the narrator drinks:

- "a glass of cold barley tea"
- "a Canadian Club on the rocks"
- "some cheap wine I'd gotten on sale, mixed with Perrier"
- "a tall glass of iced tea"
- "a mug of dark beer"
- "some iced tea"
- "a Heineken"
- "a couple of whiskeys"
- "a lemon soda"
- "an iced tea"
- "white wine"

??????

Mostly found this book quite tedious, but there was one scene that was absolutely thrilling. Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it, which is quite an achievement for an author. So Murakami is redeemed. I'll probably give him another try someday.
