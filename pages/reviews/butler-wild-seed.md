_*Spoiler alert!*_

I liked it till the end. Doro falling in love with Anyanwu made no emotional sense to me, and I found it unsatisfying that they ended up living in relative peace. I'm honestly pretty surprised that Butler managed to create two of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a fantasy novel, pit them against each other in a super compelling relationship, write tons of gripping scenes, and then fizzle out in the last ten pages with "and they lived happily ever after."
