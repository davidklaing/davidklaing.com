Overall, great book. I recommend it. My only complaint is that I don't think Malkiel takes his own argument seriously enough. He gives all this evidence that for most investors—certainly for all non-professionals—active investing is a waste of time. But then he's like, "I know that passive investing is too boring for most of you, so here are some strategies you can use to pick stocks." Huh??
