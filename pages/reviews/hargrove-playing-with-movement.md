This book is like *In Defense of Food* but for movement. The tagline could be something like "Move, not too regimented, mostly walking."

I haven't read any other books on the subject, so I don't know how it fits into the broader conversation, but I was impressed. I imagine that it's hard not to either be reductionistic or else a bit woo-woo when talking about physical health, but Hargrove really nails it.
