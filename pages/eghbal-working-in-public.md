This book gave me a much deeper appreciation for the usually unpaid work done by maintainers of open-source software. It also introduced me to the anarchist origins of open source, which I was unaware of. I'd recommend this book to people who work in software, mainly for the context that it provides around tools we use every day. For non-developers, the book is quite accessible, and definitely worth reading if the topic interests you. Pairs well with Michael Nielsen's book, _Reinventing Discovery_.
