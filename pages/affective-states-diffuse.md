Affective states have a way of diffusing into the past and future. You don't just enjoy a donut. You also enjoy the anticipation of the donut, and the memory of it.

Affective states also diffuse into the people you interact with. When you enjoy a donut, the people around you get to enjoy the it too, through your good moodâ€”even if you don't share!
