## What's my story?

I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and swim meets.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Arts_and_Science">Arts & Science program</a>, where I found my people.

After a year of teaching writing at a Niagara College in Welland, Ontario, I decided to train as a data scientist. I moved to the west coast to study in the first cohort of the <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">Master of Data Science program</a> at the University of British Columbia.

For the past four years, I've been living Vancouver with my partner, Meg. For work, I'm a senior data scientist at <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, a gaming platform.

## Why should you contact me?

Because then we might become friends! Perhaps you...

* know of something that I might find interesting.
* read something on my site that _you_ found interesting.
* want to collaborate on a project.
* want to meet me for a (virtual) coffee.
