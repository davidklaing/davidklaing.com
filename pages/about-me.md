## What's my story?

I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and swim meets.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Arts_and_Science">Arts & Science program</a>, where I found my people.

After a year of teaching writing at a Niagara College in Welland, Ontario, I decided to train as a data scientist. I moved to the west coast to study in the first cohort of the <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">Master of Data Science program</a> at the University of British Columbia.

I now live in Vancouver with my partner, Meg. I love listening to music, tinkering on the piano, playing blitz chess, and biking everywhere no matter how hard it's raining.

## What do I do for work?

- I'm a senior data scientist at <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://imbellus.com/">Imbellus</a>, a startup that makes cognitive assessments. The assessments look and feel like games, and their goal is to provide an alternative to traditional multiple-choice tests, which are great at measuring content mastery and memorization but not so great at measuring skills like decision-making, adaptability, or situational awareness. My job is to design and build scoring systems for these assessments.
- Once per year, I teach a course on communication and argumentation in the <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">Master of Data Science program</a> at the University of British Columbia. The course prepares students to communicate and reason effectively about data science topics and findings.
- I also teach a course for Hyperlink Academy called <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://hyperlink.academy/courses/write-a-micro-textbook/14">Write a Micro-Textbook</a>. The course takes a small group of people through the process of creating a substantial work of instructional writing, in five weeks.
