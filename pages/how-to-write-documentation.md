The best way to think about documentation that I have come across is from Daniele Procida. He explains it in [his talk at PyCon Australia 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg), and in a [standalone website](https://documentation.divio.com/).

The basic idea is that there isn't just a single kind of documentation—there are four:

1. Tutorials
2. How-to guides
3. Reference guides
4. Discussions

Each serves a different purpose and has its own stylistic considerations.

## Tutorials

Tutorials are learning-focused.

They take the form of a lesson, and are meant to help a beginner get started with an activity. They should inspire confidence, include lots of activities, and minimize distractions.

Food analogy: teaching a child how to cook.

## How-to guides

How-to guides are problem-focused.

They take the form of a series of steps, and are meant to help the reader solve a specific problem (often one that a beginner wouldn't even know how to formulate). They should be focused and algorithmic.

Food analogy: a recipe in a cookbook.

## Reference guides

Reference guides are information-focused.

They take the form of dry description, and are meant purely to "describe the machinery". They should accurate, up-to-date, and structurally and tonally consistent.

Food analogy: an encyclopedia article about an ingredient.

## Discussions

Discussions are understanding-focused.

They take the form of a discursive explanation, and are meant to help the reader understand a concept, a philosophy, or a history. They should provide context, and avoid instruction.

Food analogy: an article on culinary social history.

Documentation is useful to the extent that all four forms are both *present* and *separate*.

As soon as they start to bleed into each other, the documentation becomes a rat's nest—hard for readers to navigate, and hard for authors to maintain. The temptation to blend them is explained in this amazing 2x2:

- Tutorials and how-to guides are practical, while discussions and references are theoretical.
- Tutorials and discussions are useful when studying, while how-to guides and references are useful when coding.
