This book is an incredible translation of a mediocre recounting of a genre-defining story. I didn't enjoy it, but I'm glad to have spent some more time with it as a cultural artifact. Wilson's introductory essay and translator's note were far more interesting to me than the poem itself, but I had read the Fagles translation twice before, so I had the context needed to understand them. If you've never read The Odyssey, I'd recommend saving the essay and translator's note for after.
