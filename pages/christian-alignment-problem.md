I had high hopes because I loved _Algorithms to Live By_, and I wasn't let down. The book is about as good as it could be, given its goal of explaining machine learning to a general audience through the lens of human values. It's not gonna change your life or anything, but if you're looking for a crystal-clear, equation-free, comprehensive overview of the state of machine learning research, this is the book to read. Large parts of it may be outdated within 5-10 years, so the time to read it is now.
