## What is an investment policy statement?

An investment policy statement is a document that expresses the following:

1. Goals (financial outcomes). These should be stated as clearly as possible and be tied to specific times.
2. Justifications for those goals, expressed in terms of intrinsic values.
3. Anti-goals. (Tempting desires that conflict with true goals.)
4. A plan for reaching goals, consisting of:
    - Asset allocations matched to different life stages, and justifications for those allocations, and explicit statement of expected variance across individual years.
    - A statement of when and how to rebalance.
    - A statement of when and in what conditions to replace one investment with another.


## Investment philosophy

- The most important things under my control:
    - My savings rate
    - Asset allocation

- Things to remember
    - Risk depends on time horizon
    - On a long enough time horizon, stocks are low-risk as long as you can avoid selling during bad times
    - 98% of trades are made by professional investors
    - I am not a professional investor
    - I am not smarter than the average investor
    - I am less informed about asset values than the average investor
    - The stock market is not the economy
    - The bigger your safety net, the easier it is to avoid selling during a crisis
    - Non-financial assets are often more financially valuable than financial ones
    - Safety nets are comprised of both financial and non-financial assets
