## Investment philosophy

- The most important things under my control:
    - My savings rate
    - Asset allocation

- Things to remember
    - Risk depends on time horizon
    - On a long enough time horizon, stocks are extremely low-risk as long as you can avoid selling during bad times
    - 98% of trades are made by professional investors
    - I am not a professional investor
    - I am not smarter than the average investor
    - I am less informed about asset values than the average investor
    - The stock market is not the economy
    - The bigger your safety net, the easier it is to avoid selling during a crisis
    - Non-financial assets are often more financially valuable than financial ones
    - Safety nets are comprised of both financial and non-financial assets
