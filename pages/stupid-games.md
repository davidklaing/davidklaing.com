In my university days, my friends and I became obsessed with a game called Slackjaw, in which two contestants stare at each other with their jaws slack, and the first person to smile loses. If it goes on too long, a third person announces "slackjaw dance!", and the contestants have to dance while keeping their jaws slack.

Slackjaw is an example of a "stupid game": one that is played for the pleasure of failing. Other examples are Twister, Broken Telephone, Jenga, and most drinking games.

Interestingly, even though the most fun part of a stupid game is when you lose, it's only fun if you are genuinely trying to win. Stupid games are just one example of activities that engender <a id="striving-play" class="internal-link" href="/striving-play/">striving play</a>.
