The more you enjoy an activity, the more you will do it. Learning is mostly a matter of putting in your reps, so if you want to learn a skill faster, you should engineer your relationship with that skill so that you enjoy performing it as much as possible.

- Eliminate flow-stoppers that are relevant for the activity.
- Create pleasurable rituals around the activity.
- Adopt a non-instrumental mindset with respect to the skill; try to enjoy it for its own sake, rather than seeing it as a means to an end.
- Make the performance of the skill more meaningful by connecting new subskills to known sources of pleasure.
