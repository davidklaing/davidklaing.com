                <p>What is a better use of time: improving the world, or improving your ability to improve the world?</p>

<p>The best model I’ve found for thinking about this question is in Alyssa Vance’s 2011 post, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/guDcrPqLsnhEjrPZj/levels-of-action">Levels of Action</a>.</p>

<p>When you use your existing skills to do direct work, you are taking a “Level 1 action”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that you go onto <a href="http://mturk.amazon.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>, open an account, and spend a hundred hours transcribing audio. At current market rates, you’d get paid around $100 for your labor. By taking this action, you have made yourself ​$100 wealthier. This is an example of what I’d call a Level 1 or object-level action: something that directly moves the world from a less desirable state into a more desirable state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you invest time in improving your skills, you are taking a “Level 2 action”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] suppose you take a typing class, which teaches you to type twice as fast. On the object level, this doesn’t move the world into a better state—nothing about the world has changed, other than you. However, the typing class can still be very useful, because every Level 1 project you tackle later which involves typing will go better—you’ll be able to do it more efficiently, and you’ll get a higher return on your time. This is what I’d call a Level 2 or meta-level action, because it doesn’t make the world better directly—it makes the world better indirectly, by improving the effectiveness of Level 1 actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the use in categorizing actions in this way? For one thing, it helps you to understand whether you are overweighting actions of a certain level. As Vance points out,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important difference between Level 1 and Level 2 actions is that Level 1 actions tend to be additive, while Level 2 actions tend to be multiplicative. If you do ten hours of work at McDonald’s, you’ll get paid ten times as much as if you did one hour; the benefits of the hours add together. However, if you take ten typing classes, each one of which improves your ability by 20%, you’ll be 1.2^10 = 6.2 times better at the end than at the beginning: the benefits of the classes multiply (assuming independence).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you only ever take Level 1 actions, you will never improve your throughput. However, if you only ever take Level 2 actions, you will never accomplish <em>anything</em>, since even the largest number multiplied by zero is still zero.</p>

<p>There is no simple answer to how much you should prioritize each level of action, but there are a few helpful heuristics.</p>

<p>One is to get “both the benefits of Level 1 and Level 2 actions […] by going out and doing Level 1 things that one hasn’t done before.”</p>

<p>The first time I took public transit on my own, in grade 8, I stood at the wrong stop for 45 minutes, trying to flag down express buses as they soared past me. When I was finally picked up, I had no clue how to alert the driver of my stop, so when the time came I nonchalantly walked up to him and said, “this is me.”</p>

<p>The more of a beginner you are at any given task, the more you’re in Level 2 when doing that task. But I still made it to swim practice! As educational as the experience was, I accomplished a Level 1 action.</p>

<p>Nowadays I think about this in my professional life: which useful tasks could I complete at work that I’ve never done before? Usually the first thing a programmer learns to do is print the phrase “hello world.” What is the ‘hello world’ of conducting interviews? Of project management? Of graphic design?</p>

<p>Another heuristic is to focus more on Level 2 actions early in life, and gradually shift to Level 1 as you get older. It makes sense that most people go through vocational training as young adults rather than after retirement: the earlier you multiply, the larger the total sum.</p>

<p>Consider also that Level 2 isn’t the highest level of action, since there are actions you can take which improve your ability to improve your ability to affect the world—meta-meta-level actions. Vance illustrates this point well (with a bit of a nasty jab):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Witness the hordes of lawyers who spend thirty years on the Level 1 action of working at a law firm, three years on the Level 2 action of getting a law degree, and three minutes on the Level 3 action of deciding what to do after college.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some questions I’m reflecting on as I consider the ideas in this post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What levels of action do I tend to spend the most time in?</li>
  <li>What levels of action should I spend more or less time in, given my stage of life?</li>
  <li>What are some actions I could take that would span multiple levels?</li>
</ul>
