    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-06-24</em><hr/><p>This is a summary of Albert-László Barabási’s 2018 book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39088545-the-formula">The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success</a>. I generally steer clear of books with titles like this one, but Barabási is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">well-regarded network scientist</a>, so I thought he might have substantive ideas on what drives success. It turns out he does, and they are quite easy to summarize.</p><p>Generally, ‘success’ just means the achievement of a goal. But in this book, Barabási uses the word to mean something more specific: “the rewards we earn from the communities we belong to.” In particular, this type of success is distinct from performance, in that performance is about what you can do, whereas success is about how you are recognized for what you can do.</p><p>The book devotes one chapter to each of what Barabási calls the universal laws of success:</p><ol><li>Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success.</li><li>Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded.</li><li>Previous success x fitness = future success.</li><li>While team success requires diversity and balance, a single individual will receive credit for the group’s achievements.</li><li>With persistence success can come at any time.</li></ol><p>Barabási emphasizes that these laws are not recommendations per se, but rather they are claims about a phenomenon. They are meant to help us reason about how social status flows through networks and accrues to individuals within them. That being said, the laws have clear implications for what a person should do if they are seeking success, so after each law I share what I think those implications are.</p><h2 id="the-universal-laws-of-success">The universal laws of success</h2><h3 id="1-performance-drives-success-but-when-performance-cant-be-measured-networks-drive-success">1. Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success.</h3><p>In domains where performance is easy to measure, like in athletics or games, networks don’t count for much. If you can beat Magnus Carlsen at chess or beat Tiger Woods at golf, it doesn’t matter who you know; you’ll get plenty of recognition.</p><p>But in domains where performance is harder or even impossible to measure, like in the arts, in academics, and in most professions, performance only gets you so far. If you have ever seen a virtuosic street-performing musician and wondered why they weren’t world famous, it’s probably because music isn’t a game with strict rules and unambiguous scores. The harder it is to rank people directly by their skill or by the quality of their contributions, the more their differences in success will be caused by their network: who they know and how well they are liked.</p><h4 id="lessons">Lessons</h4><ul><li>In domains where performance is easy to measure, focus on improving your performance.</li><li>In domains where performance is hard to measure, focus on providing something of value to the relevant community.</li></ul><h3 id="2-performance-is-bounded-but-success-is-unbounded">2. Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded.</h3><p>Usain Bolt is only a few milliseconds faster than the second fastest sprinter in the world, but he is vastly more famous. Not only that, but Bolt is at most about 2x faster than me, and I’m just a random guy off the street. Mathematically, performance and success are different beasts: the former is about bell curves, while the latter is about long tails.</p><h4 id="lessons-1">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Hitting a plateau in performance does not imply hitting a plateau in success.</li><li>Unless you have the potential to be the best of the best performers, don’t seek success in domains where performance is easy to measure.</li></ul><h3 id="3-previous-success-x-fitness--future-success">3. Previous success x fitness = future success.</h3><p>In network dynamics, an individual’s ‘fitness’ is like their stickiness—how easily they retain the attention and positive regard of others who encounter them. At a conference, your fitness is defined by how good an impression you make during smalltalk at a poster session. On the internet, your fitness is defined by the appeal of your website or your profile—how you describe yourself, the visual style you project, and your recent activity.</p><p>Of course, fitness doesn’t count for much in the short term if you don’t encounter many people. The other factor that matters in predicting future success is how much success you have already achieved. In a 1999 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model">paper</a>, Barabási and his colleague Réka Albert coined the term <em>preferential attachment</em> to describe how wealth or credit ‘attaches’ itself to people according to how much they already have, causing a rich-get-richer effect. When you observe an individual’s rise to fame in a network, it often starts slow because the compounding effects of their fitness aren’t obvious until after many rounds of multiplication.</p><h4 id="lessons-2">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Be patient.</li><li>Increase your fitness.</li><li>Have as many encounters as possible, especially with influential nodes in your network.</li></ul><h3 id="4-while-team-success-requires-diversity-and-balance-a-single-individual-will-receive-credit-for-the-groups-achievements">4. While team success requires diversity and balance, a single individual will receive credit for the group’s achievements.</h3><p>The members of a team have a good understanding of who contributed what, but this information is usually inaccessible to outside observers. Observers will therefore assign credit using heuristics—giving it to, say, the person who is most vocal, or the most senior, or whose outputs were most visible, or whose past experience is most consistent with this type of work. Imagine if I were to study under Barabási and co-author a paper with him. Even if I did most of the work, the scientific community would think of it as Barabási’s new paper, not mine, because this would be their first time hearing my name.</p><h4 id="lessons-3">Lessons</h4><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/talk-more/" id="talk-more">Speak up.</a></li><li>Work on things that are visible.</li><li>Build a specific reputation for the thing you want to be recognized for.</li></ul><h3 id="5-with-persistence-success-can-come-at-any-time">5.

In particular, it is assumed that creativity is strongly related to a person’s age, and that it is at its peak during the early stages of their career. If you believe this, you might think that if you’re past your prime, you might as well not even try.</p><p>Barabási’s research suggests a different model: age predicts <em>productivity</em>, and productivity predicts creative success. In other words, each project completed has a similar probability of being a breakout hit, but because people tend to complete more projects early in their careers, this is when they most commonly achieve success. This means that there’s no reason to be fatalistic about having missed your opportunity; the key is to keep producing.</p><h4 id="lessons-4">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Keep producing good work.</li><li>Don’t second-guess yourself because of your age.</li></ul><h2 id="core-takeaways">Core takeaways</h2><p>To summarize the lessons from all of Barabási’s laws, the path to success is simple:</p><ul><li>Patiently produce a large volume of work in public.</li><li>Build relationships and provide value to your community.</li><li>Craft your image so that when people encounter you, they want to keep you in their circle.</li></ul></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Atomic Habits</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-01-14</em><hr/><p>In an <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/north-star-podcast/daniel-gross-dreams-and-e8iC1HhrjDt/">episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell</a>, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was very wise:</p><blockquote><p>The definition of a habit, for me, is something that doesn’t require willpower. How can I build a large collection of habits that are healthy—that are correct—and save them to RAM in my head so that I don’t have to think about them? I would like to have that done by the end of my 20s. I’d like to be in a good place in terms of body composition, in terms of what I eat, in terms of how I work, so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about that stuff.</p></blockquote><p>I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and I got to thinking about which habits I might want to build or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear’s new book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits &amp; Build Good Ones</a>.</p><p>The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38 times better than when you started (\(1.01^{365} = 37.8\)). It’s often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible but consistent short-term differences. Hence, <em>atomic</em> habits: pennies that grow into a fortune.</p><p>Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cue</strong>. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.</li><li>The <strong>craving</strong>. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.</li><li>The <strong>response</strong>. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.</li><li>The <strong>reward</strong>. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.</li></ul><p>Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull to influence your behaviour. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear’s method.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>To build a good habit</th><th>To break a bad one</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cue</td><td>Make it obvious</td><td>Make it invisible</td></tr><tr><td>Craving</td><td>Make it attractive</td><td>Make it unattractive</td></tr><tr><td>Response</td><td>Make it easy</td><td>Make it hard</td></tr><tr><td>Reward</td><td>Make it satisfying</td><td>Make it unsatisfying</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you’ve done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then you might be familiar with many of these ideas already. This was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I think you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I’ll describe the ideas that I’ve implemented myself since reading it.</p><h2 id="habit-stacking">Habit stacking</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to start performing a new habit directly following another one that is already ingrained, you turn the old habit’s reward into the new habit’s cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven into your life.</p><p>Last year, I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. I’m more hydrated than ever.</p><h2 id="implementation-intentions">Implementation intentions</h2><p>In a study, two groups were asked to make to-do lists, but one group was given a small tweak that resulted in them accomplishing many more tasks than the other. They were told to write down with each task the time and location where they intended to complete it. They created an implementation intention. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious, this time by associating the action with a context that can be perceived as the cue.</p><p>I’ve started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card</em>, it’s <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning</em>. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task has helped me cross a number of them off.</p><h2 id="prime-your-environment">Prime your environment</h2><p>I first learned the value of this lesson three years ago when I lived in a tiny coach house in Welland, Ontario. I had always struggled to get out of bed on time, but I was teaching courses of my own for the first time and couldn’t afford to be late for class. So I came up with a solution. Each night before bed, I prepared my stovetop espresso maker and put it on the stove, alongside a clean mug and my phone (my alarm). When my alarm started ringing, I had to get out of bed and walk over to the stove to turn it off. Immediately, I would turn on the stove element and go back to bed for a snooze. Ten minutes later I would be woken again by the gurgling of the espresso, as well as the fear that it would boil over if I didn’t get up to turn off the element. My reward for getting up the second time was a fresh cup of coffee. Ever since then I’ve been completely cured of my snoozing habit.</p><p>As Clear explains, priming your environment for its next use is a great way to make a desirable behaviour more obvious as well as easier. After reflecting on this, I’ve been experimenting with a few changes:</p><ul><li>Pumping up my bike tires as soon as I get home from my evening bike commute. (This makes it easier to choose the bike as my mode of transport the next day.)</li><li>Repacking my gym bag as soon as I get home from the gym. (This makes it easier to go for a work-out whenever I feel like it.)</li><li>Filling up a big water jug next to my desk at the end of each work day. (This makes it easier to stay hydrated the next day. Note that putting the water jug there also makes my drinking habit more obvious.)</li><li>Placing a novel on my pillow after making my bed each morning. (I’m trying to build the habit of reading fiction before bed because I find that it helps me sleep.)</li></ul><h2 id="make-it-small">Make it small</h2><p>I’ve used various habit trackers for about four years now, and I’ve just about settled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.tasklife&amp;hl=en">TaskLife</a> as my favourite. I define a list of behaviours, and each day the app asks me whether I’ve done them. The beauty of it is that I can choose the frequency with which I want to perform each task, as well as the time period over which to calculate that frequency. It’s like Andy Matuschak’s system of <a href="http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/169043084412/successful-habits-through-smoothly-ratcheting">smoothly ratcheting targets with teeth</a>, minus a bit of smoothness and all the teeth.</p><p>The most common reason that I’ve failed to hit my target frequency has been the size of my tasks—they have been too hard. For example, it’s often hard to find the time and motivation for one full hour of writing, so I would often skip that habit. Even before reading Atomic Habits, I had recognized this problem and made some changes, like cutting 60 minutes of writing down to 10. But Clear offered many more ways to break down a complex or challenging behaviour into a task that can be completed in under two minutes. Since getting started is by far the hardest part of most habits, I decided to change all my habits in TaskLife to 2-minutes-or-under tasks as a way of making it easier to spend time on the things that matter to me. Here is the current list of questions that TaskLife asks me each morning about my previous day, along with the frequency with which I aim to complete those tasks over a rolling window of 21 days:</p><ul><li>Did you study at least one flashcard? (70%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of fiction? (70%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence? (55%)</li><li>Did you read at least one <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> article? (50%)</li><li>Did you play at least one chord on the guitar? (50%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence in your journal? (50%)</li><li>Did you go to bed by 9:30pm? (50%)</li><li>Did you send at least one message to a friend? (50%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of nonfiction? (40%)</li><li>Did you walk through the doors of the gym? (25%)</li></ul><h2 id="automate-it">Automate it</h2><p>Lastly, the easiest way to make a task easier is to delegate it to a machine. As a data scientist, I have obviously implemented this one before, too. I’ve automated my health insurance payments, my donations to charity, my bus pass top-ups, my <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">memorization efforts</a>, my <a href="https://www.fitbit.com">sleep tracking, my exercise tracking</a>, and my rebalancing calculations in my investment accounts. But there are always more things to automate, and Clear’s chapter on the subject got me to reflect on what else I could do. Since reading the chapter, I’ve set up automatic payments on all of my regular bills, and on my to-do list (with an implementation intention!) is the task of setting up automatic monthly transfers into my investment accounts.</p><p>In summary, I highly recommend Atomic Habits. If the topic of habit formation is new to you, I think this book is probably the best general resource you’ll find. And if the topic is already familiar, you’ll find that the book is a quick and engaging read with dozens of fresh ideas that you can consider implementing in your life.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Altered Traits</h1><p>As far as I know, Altered Traits is the current best lay summary of meditation research. Some highlights:</p><p>There is a TON of meditation research out there, but the vast majority has serious methodological flaws. For example: not distinguishing between types of meditation, not keeping track of lifetime hours of experience, not using active control groups, etc. Still, there are a few findings that seem solid.</p><p>One is that meditation follows a dose-response relationship that doesn’t seem to plateau even at the highest levels of experience. There are significant differences between people with 10,000 lifetime hours and people with 20,000.</p><p>Another is that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), the 8-week program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn (probably the most widespread form of meditation in the West) has real health benefits, and it especially helps people reappraise pain or illness. That being said, some of MBSR’s health benefits appear to come not from the mindfulness training itself, but from the greater focus on healthy living, usually with a community of others who are trying to make similar changes. Also, those benefits fade without continued practice.</p><p>Another is that different types of meditation have different effects, not only on one’s states (in-the-moment experiences), but also on one’s traits (long-term, stable characteristics). Mindfulness and vipassina train focus, and lessen reactivity, whereas loving-kindness trains compassion.</p><p>Loving-kindness meditation is pretty interesting. It’s much less discussed than mindfulness, but it appears to have a much faster and more noticeable effect. Just a few minutes of loving-kindness meditation can boost a person’s mood in a lasting way. It also seems to increase a person’s likelihood of acting to help others who are in pain, possibly through a dampening of emotional empathy (à la Paul Bloom’s Against Empathy).</p><p>The craziest thing I learned in Altered Traits was that there are yogis out there who literally meditate all day every day for their entire lives, and it leaves a noticeable footprint on their brains. These people’s brains have near-constant gamma waves, which are the highest frequency neural oscillation in humans. It’s unclear to me how gamma waves are related to experience, but the authors suggested that you get a burst of gamma waves when you, say, bite into an apple.</p><p>After reading Altered Traits, my overall impression is that meditation research (or “contemplative science”, as it’s now sometimes called) is still pretty young. I’ll be interested to see how it develops over the years. I definitely recommend the book, if the topic interests you.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>The Righteous Mind</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2016-09-01</em><hr/><p>This is a chapter-by-chapter summary of Jonathan Haidt’s book, <a class="external-link" href="https://righteousmind.com/" target="_self">The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>How do people think about right and wrong? This is an empirical question, and <em>The Righteous Mind</em>’s primary goal is to answer it. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt tells the story of how his research led him to formulate Moral Foundations Theory, which claims that the human mind responds to combinations of six moral “taste receptors”: Care, Liberty, Fairness, Authority, Loyalty, and Sanctity.</p><p>The theory and its implications are presented in three parts. In Part I, Haidt shows that our conscious moral reasoning is done not to find the truth, but to preserve our reputations by justifying our intuitions. In Part II, he gives a full account of those intuitions and he shows how they differ across the political spectrum. In Part III, he argues that morality evolved through natural selection as a group-level adaptation; among our ancestors, the groups who were unified by collective moral principles were best able to turn resources into offspring.</p><p>In the final chapter, Haidt transitions from description to prescription, offering insights into how we might recognize the shortcomings of our own moral tribes, benefit from the most sensible ideas of other tribes, and work together to design a better society that acknowledges certain crucial facts of human psychology.</p><h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>Because this book aims to describe the psychology of morality, it might have made sense to title it The Moral Mind. However, “righteous” better captures a feature of the mind that is crucial for understanding why we hold ourselves to certain principles: we hold each other to those principles too. We are righteous, moralistic, and judgmental. These qualities are crucial for maintaining safe and productive societies, but they also lead to much enmity and moralistic strife within our communities. In order to parlay this strife into the mutually beneficial conversations that should be possible in democratic societies, we must first recognize that we are all hypocrites, that we all mean well, and that we will understand each other better if we first understand ourselves.</p><h3 id="part-1-intuitions-come-first-strategic-reasoning-second">Part 1: Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-1-where-does-morality-come-from">Chapter 1: Where Does Morality Come From?</h4><p>When Haidt decided to pursue moral psychology as a graduate student in the late 1980s, the field was dominated by rationalism, the theory that morality comes from reason. Rationalists believe that people become moral by learning that since they don’t like to be harmed, it must be wrong to harm others. Harm is thus central to rationalism; without it, there is no such thing as a moral dilemma. In cultures where people seem to condemn harmless acts (e.g. masturbation), rationalists assume those people must have supernatural beliefs (e.g. belief in hell) that make those acts seem harmful.</p><p>Haidt suspected that rationalism was wrong, so he conducted surveys across many cultures and reached three conclusions. First, morality varies greatly by culture, and it often concerns much more than harm. Second, people often have gut feelings about morality—often related to disgust—that they cannot justify but still hold to be true. Third, it can’t be true that morality is constructed entirely through a growing understanding of harm, or else people wouldn’t condemn acts that they themselves agree are not harmful. Thus, morality must come not from reason but from some combination of innateness and social learning. But even if this is true, a question remains: what are people doing when they reason about morality?</p><h4 id="chapter-2-the-intuitive-dog-and-its-rational-tail">Chapter 2: The Intuitive Dog and Its Rational Tail</h4><p>There are three hypotheses regarding the relationship between reason and intuition. One is found in Plato’s dialogue Timaeus, in which humans are described as perfect rational souls encased in imperfect emotional bodies. In Plato’s model, reason is the master and intuition is the slave. The converse of Plato’s hypothesis is that of the Scottish philosopher David Hume, who wrote in 1739 that intuition is the master and reason is the slave. A third option was put forth by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in 1786 that reason and intuition are co-rulers of the mind.</p><p>Drawing on findings from cognitive psychology, Haidt argues that Hume was right. To help readers understand how reason and intuition work together in the mind, he develops a metaphor: intuition is an elephant, massive and non-verbal, and reason is a tiny rider who sits on top, defending the elephant’s movements but relatively powerless to steer them. This explains why you can’t change people’s minds simply by refuting their arguments; those arguments were produced by the rider to justify what the elephant was already doing. To use another metaphor, “You can’t make a dog happy by forcibly wagging its tail” (48). Dogs wag their tails to communicate their happiness, and people use reason to communicate their intuitions.</p><p>Thus, in response to rationalism, Haidt presents the social intuitionist model of moral psychology, so named because it claims that morality comes from intuitions that are shaped by genetic predispositions and social learning.</p><h4 id="chapter-3-elephants-rule">Chapter 3: Elephants Rule</h4><p>Haidt presents six empirical findings that support the social intuitionist model:</p><ol><li>Intuitive judgments are powerful, instant, and constant. Experimental psychologists have long known that with every perception comes a tiny flash of either positive or negative affect, often so subtle that we don’t notice it. These flashes cause our elephants to lean one way or another, and our riders are always anticipating the next step.</li><li>Political and social judgments are especially intuitive. When asked to rate emotionally loaded words (such as “happy” or “angry”) as positive or negative, people are slowed down significantly when positive words are shown next to images of unattractive people, immigrants, or the elderly. Even if such judgments would not be endorsed by our riders, they still arise without conscious control.</li><li>Our bodies guide our judgments, often by activating feelings of disgust. When asked to make moral judgments in the presence of fart spray, people are more condemnatory. Associations with purity and cleanliness also affect moral judgments. When asked to make a series of judgments while standing next to a bottle of hand sanitizer, people become temporarily more conservative.</li><li>Psychopaths reason but don’t feel, and are severely morally deficient. Their elephants don’t react to shame, guilt, or human dignity, and so psychopaths feel no compunction when they behave in monstrous ways. Meanwhile, their riders serve their elephants just as well as anyone’s do, which means psychopaths can reason, plan, and even charm their victims. If the rationalists were correct, then psychopaths would be just as moral as the rest of us.</li><li>Babies feel but don’t reason, and have the beginnings of morality. As early as two months old, babies show evidence of their many intuitions when they stare longer at things that surprise them than at things that don’t. After being shown a short video of someone climbing a hill and being repeatedly pushed down by one person while being repeatedly helped up by another, babies are surprised to see the climber cozy up to the pusher rather than the helper. If the rationalists were correct, then babies would have no sense of right and wrong until long after they’d been personally harmed in a social environment.</li><li>In the brain, moral judgments happen in the right place at the right time to support social intuitionism. When asked to make moral judgments while attached to an fMRI scanner, people are shown to activate regions in their brains associated with emotional processing. High activity in these regions correlates with the judgments people ultimately make. It is as if we can watch the elephant lurch in real time.</li></ol><p>Elephants can respond to reason, especially when reason gives rise to new intuitions. But the best way to change elephants is not through argument, but through stories, art, or friendly social contexts, in which riders are not so obsessively protective of their masters.</p><h4 id="chapter-4-vote-for-me-heres-why">Chapter 4: Vote for Me (Here’s Why)</h4><p>The “social” part of the social intuitionist model comes from an insight of evolutionary psychology: in our ancestors’ mighty struggle to survive and find a mate, it was less important to know the truth than it was to maintain one’s reputation within the group. The rider is therefore much like a press secretary, ready at any moment to vindicate the president’s decisions. Haidt supports this view with five premises:</p><ol><li>We are obsessed with our reputations, even if we don’t realize it. In one experiment, people are told to talk about themselves into a microphone. While they speak, they can see a number on a screen that rises and falls according to an anonymous listener’s desire to meet them—or so they are told. In fact, the experimenter simply makes the number rise for some people and fall for others. Unsurprisingly, people’s self-esteem, as they describe it in the moments after, is greatly affected by the numbers they see, even when they go into the experiment believing they don’t care what other people think of them.</li><li>When we believe something, we look for evidence that confirms it instead of evidence that would falsify it. Look at the sequence “2, 4, 6.” What is the pattern? When people are allowed to test their hypothesis with other sequences, they typically say things like “8, 10, 12” or “100, 102, 104,” which both confirm their hypothesis: “three numbers that increase by intervals of two.” But that’s wrong. It doesn’t occur to people to guess “1, 6, 20” or “3, 2, 1.” If they had been looking to falsify their hunches, then they might have eventually reached the correct answer: “three numbers arranged in increasing order.” We look to confirm our ideas, not to put them on trial.</li><li>We are able to lie to ourselves, and believe those lies, whenever we want to conceal our own wrongdoing. In a series of experiments in which people attempt a series of math problems and then get paid for the number they manage to solve, the majority of people exaggerate when they are told to report their own result—even more so when they can destroy the evidence. So, most people cheat some of the time, but only to the extent that they can still convince themselves that their cheating was an honest mistake; the goal is to preserve one’s reputation, and lying is easier if you believe your own lies.</li><li>When evaluating a proposition we wish to believe, we tend to ask, “can I believe it?” Our riders are creative, and they can almost always come up with a reason for the answer to be “yes.” When evaluating a proposition we don’t wish to believe, we tend to ask, “must I believe it?” Our riders can almost always come up with a reason for the answer to be “no.”</li><li>When called upon to defend and support our groups, we activate regions of our brains related to pleasure and pain depending on the type of information we encounter. For example, an extreme partisan’s brain shows increased activity in areas related to negative emotion and punishment when they see their beloved leader acting hypocritically; but when they learn new information that exonerates their leader, the partisan gets a flash of pleasure as dopamine is released. Our brains don’t care about the truth. They care about our status within our groups.</li></ol><h3 id="part-ii-theres-more-to-morality-than-harm-and-fairness">Part II: There’s More to Morality than Harm and Fairness</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-5-beyond-weird-morality">Chapter 5: Beyond WEIRD Morality</h4><p>People in societies that are WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) are statistical outliers on many measures of morality. Most notably, they tend to see the world as a collection of discrete, autonomous individuals, which leads their morality to focus mainly on harm, oppression, and inequality. Most other cultures see the world as a collection of relationships that ought to be protected even at the expense of the individuals who make them up. In these cultures, and in religious and conservative sub-cultures in the West, morality involves a broader set of concerns, often involving community and divinity. Moral matrices—the collection of values shared by a particular community—bind people together and blind them to the possibility that there might be other legitimate ways to judge people and organize society.</p><h4 id="chapter-6-taste-buds-of-the-righteous-mind">Chapter 6: Taste Buds of the Righteous Mind</h4><p>There are two predominant systems of prescriptive ethics in Western culture: utilitarianism and deontology. Utilitarianism, developed by the 18th-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, says that moral behavior is that which maximizes the intensity, duration, and certainty of “hedons” (measures of pleasure) and minimizes those of “dolors” (measures of pain). Deontology, developed by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, says that moral behavior is that which anyone could will to become a universal law.</p><p>Though Haidt does not wish to discount the great value that utilitarianism and deontology have brought to Western society, he notes that both theories were developed by men who measured high on systematizing and low on empathy. Thus, these men were likely blind to certain crucial facts of human psychology. Haidt believes we can find a better starting point for both descriptive and prescriptive theories of ethics in David Hume, who acknowledged that morality involves numerous and often contradictory concerns that vary between cultures.</p><p>To figure out what those basic concerns are, Haidt and his research team borrowed a concept from cognitive anthropology called modularity. A module is an innate cognitive program that responds automatically to a particular perception—for example, one module is our ability to recognize faces. The first draft of any module is written in our genes by our evolutionary history, and then it gets tweaked by experience, sometimes through cultural learning. After reviewing the evidence of how people across cultures reason about morality, Haidt and his research team identified five initial candidates for modules that bear on moral psychology: care, fairness, authority, loyalty, and sanctity.</p><h4 id="chapter-7-the-moral-foundations-of-politics">Chapter 7: The Moral Foundations of Politics</h4><p>Haidt tells the full story of how he reasoned from our ancestors’ adaptive challenges to come up with a first draft of Moral Foundations Theory:</p><ol><li>Care/harm. This foundation helped our ancestors raise their children, who were completely dependent for the first few years of life. It gets activated when we see cute children or animals, especially if they are helpless and suffering.</li><li>Fairness/cheating. This foundation helped our ancestors form two-way alliances and benefit from cooperation while protecting them from cheaters. It gets activated when we feel gratitude toward those who help us, and anger toward those who hurt us.</li><li>Loyalty/betrayal. This foundation helped our ancestors form effective coalitions that could outcompete other groups that were less unified. It gets activated when we root for our favorite sports teams or swell with pride while singing our national anthem.</li><li>Authority/subversion. This foundation helped our ancestors establish beneficial relationships within hierarchies. It gets activated when we feel respect or fear for our bosses or parents.</li><li>Sanctity/degradation. This foundation helped to protect our ancestors from pathogens and unsafe food. It gets activated when we feel disgust or reverence for people or symbols, or when we shrink away from words or ideas that are taboo.</li></ol><h4 id="chapter-8-the-conservative-advantage">Chapter 8: The Conservative Advantage</h4><p>Survey data from over 130,000 people show that liberal voters value care and fairness above all other moral foundations, and that conservative voters value all five foundations equally. This explains why the Democratic Party often has such a hard time connecting with voters. Democrats can’t understand why poor rural Americans tend to vote Republican when it is the Democrats who want to distribute money more equally. The answer is that rural Americans value all six moral foundations, which are found in Republican rhetoric but not in Democratic rhetoric. As Haidt says, “Republicans understand moral psychology. Democrats don’t.” (156)</p><p>In the summer of 2008, Haidt was nervous that Obama’s two-foundation rhetoric might cost the Democrats the presidency. To help Democrats appeal to more voters, Haidt wrote an essay for Edge.org with the title, “What Makes People Vote Republican?” He contrasted two visions of society—one from the utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, who viewed the ideal society as one that prized individual autonomy above all else, and another from the French sociologist Émile Durkheim, who saw society as a set of valuable relationships that had developed organically over time as people learned how to suppress each other’s selfishness. Haidt explained in the essay that a Durkheimian society is a better fit for human psychology, and that the Democrats should try to capitalize on that fact as much as Republicans do.</p><p>Haidt received many emails from both liberals and conservatives after writing that essay, and they contained moral content that could not be easily categorized using Moral Foundations Theory in its current form. This led him to split the Fairness/cheating foundation into two separate foundations:</p><ol><li>Liberty/oppression. This foundation helped our egalitarian hunter-gatherer ancestors to rally against tyrannical alpha males who abused their power within the hierarchy of the group. For liberals, this foundation is almost as important as Care/harm, and it motivates them to advocate for sub-groups who appear to have been oppressed by traditional social structures.</li><li>Fairness/proportionality. This foundation helped our ancestors to maintain moral communities in which people were punished and rewarded in proportion to their deeds. This foundation is valued on both sides of the political spectrum, but slightly more on the right; conservatives resent liberal policies that appear to reward free riders.</li></ol><h3 id="part-iii-morality-binds-and-blinds">Part III: Morality Binds and Blinds</h3><p><em>Central metaphor: We are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee.</em></p><h4 id="chapter-9-why-are-we-so-groupish">Chapter 9: Why Are We So Groupish?</h4><p>In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin proposed the idea that certain moral emotions were selected for because they gave a competitive advantage to groups who could better unify to turn resources into offspring. This hypothesis is called group selection, and it fell out of favor in the 1970s when the evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and George Williams argued that individual selection better explains why certain groups are more successful than others. To sum up their argument, “A fast herd of deer is nothing more than a herd of fast deer” (196).</p><p>The debate has been revived in recent years, and Haidt believes group selection provides the best explanation for many features of the mind. He presents four premises in defense of group selection:</p><ol><li>Throughout the history of life on earth, there have been around half a dozen “major transitions,” in which multiple individual carriers of genes bound themselves together to increase their collective chance of reproducing. This is what happened 2 million years ago when two prokaryotes combined to create the first eukaryote, which had multiple organelles that could then only reproduce when the whole cell did. This happened again when eukaryotes first combined to form multi-cellular organisms, and again when certain animals began cooperating to defend a shared nest, to feed offspring over an extended period, and to win conflicts against other groups. Good examples of these animals are ants and bees, which accomplish much more as colonies than they would as individuals. Another example is Homo sapiens after the development of agriculture.</li><li>Before our ancestors began to work well in groups, they must have had shared intentionality: the ability to recognize when other people wanted to achieve the same goals as them. This ability must have predated the development of language, since language is not a relationship between a word and an object but an agreement between people over a relationship between a word and a mental representation. Shared intentionality allows for the development of a moral matrix, and it explains how group selection could have bound together communities of non-kin humans in the same way that kin relations bound together hives of ants and bees.</li><li>Genes and culture coevolve. For example, early adult cattle-herders couldn’t digest cow milk because lactase, the enzyme which breaks down lactose, used to be produced only in children while they were young enough to breastfeed. But over many generations, the children whose lactase lasted longer than usual could benefit from cow milk for longer than their peers, which ultimately led to full communities of adults who could digest milk. The cultural evolution of cattle herding led to the genetic evolution of lactase-production in adults, which led to further creation of dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Similarly, it is plausible that cultural developments such as moral matrices led humans to choose more cooperative mates than they would have before, which made some groups more successful than others, and this in turn led to the genetic evolution of groupish behavior.</li><li>Evolution can happen fast, and it works on the level of groups. If you want to breed chickens to lay more eggs, it doesn’t make sense to breed the individuals that lay the most eggs, since those are usually the most aggressive ones in each cage, and the death rate would increase. If you instead select the most productive cages, the death rate will plummet in just a few generations, leaving you far more cooperative chickens and many more eggs. Similarly, our own ancestors faced several near-existential disasters that wiped out huge portions of the global population; it seems very plausible that the people who survived to pass on their genes were not the most aggressive individuals, but the most cooperative groups.</li></ol><p>Haidt does not claim that all of human psychology is the product of group selection—far from it. Rather, something like 90% of our mental modules resulted from individual selection over millions of years after our ancestors diverged from those of chimpanzees. But once our ancestors began to evolve alongside culture, they developed a few bee-like mental modules that bound them together into increasingly cooperative groups.</p><h4 id="chapter-10-the-hive-switch">Chapter 10: The Hive Switch</h4><p>Most of the time we pursue individual goals and maintain a strong sense of self. But in certain situations, we are apt to lose ourselves and feel that we are part of a greater whole. Haidt calls this the “hive switch.” It can be activated in many ways, such as when we feel awe in nature, when we take drugs such as LSD and MDMA, or when we move in synchrony with many other people (e.g. soldiers marching in time, or dancers at a rave).</p><p>Two recent findings in neuroscience support the idea of the hive switch and give some insight into how it operates. One is the hormone oxytocin, which makes us more trusting and more caring toward members of our in-groups. The other is mirror neurons, which activate when we perceive another person’s behavior and feel compelled to imitate them, especially when that person shares our moral matrix; this is why we automatically return our friends’ smiles, for example. The hive switch offers three insights for institutions that want to make their members more cooperative: increase similarity, not diversity; exploit synchrony; and create healthy competition among teams, not individuals.</p><h4 id="chapter-11-religion-is-a-team-sport">Chapter 11: Religion Is a Team Sport</h4><p>After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, a profusion of new books decried religion as a parasite that preys on unscientific minds. This view was promulgated by the New Atheists—Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens—who viewed religion primarily as a set of supernatural beliefs that directly cause all religious behaviors, from peaceful congregations to suicide bombings. The New Atheists saw that religion comes with the risk of great violence, and believed that there are better ways to glean its supposed benefits. So, they claimed that the world would be better without it.</p><p>Haidt argues that religion was a critical innovation that evolved through cultural group selection to produce much of what we now value in society. The reason the New Atheists fail to see this is that their model of religious psychology involves only two factors—belief and action—when there is in fact a crucial third: belonging. Haidt agrees with the New Atheists that the first step in creating the mental module for religion is in our tendency to see patterns where none exist (e.g. we see faces in the clouds). But where the New Atheists think the next step is that religion parasitically passes from one brain to the next, Haidt thinks the next step is the creation of moral capital. Whenever a religion is compelling enough to be shared by an entire community, it provides a framework for a shared moral matrix, which makes the group more cohesive and thus better at turning resources into offspring.</p><p>Evolutionary fitness isn’t the same thing as societal health, but perhaps religion deserves more credit as one of the forces that enabled our ancestors to cooperate so successfully on such a large scale. As Haidt points out, atheistic societies have never existed until recently (in parts of Europe), and they are downright horrible at turning resources (of which they have many) into offspring (of which they have few).</p><h4 id="chapter-12-cant-we-all-disagree-more-constructively">Chapter 12: Can’t We All Disagree More Constructively?</h4><p>What makes a person vote liberal or conservative? Drawing from studies of identical twins separated at birth, Haidt shows that most of the variance in the relevant personality traits is attributable to genetics, not to environmental factors. As people grow up, they construct life narratives that work in tandem with their innate tendencies and make them more or less likely to identify with various political narratives. Voters all across the political spectrum are psychologically normal, they all mean well, and they all have insights into how to build a healthy society.</p><p>In Haidt’s opinion, liberals offer two crucial insights that other groups tend to miss. One is that certain institutional norms can put sub-groups at a disadvantage, and we should work to make sure nobody is systematically oppressed in pursuit of the greater good. The second liberal insight is that governments should play some role in regulating the activities of corporations, which often produce harmful externalities. Haidt believes that libertarians, whose morality is singularly focused on the liberty/oppression foundation, have an important insight as well: markets are often miraculous. If governments are too zealous in their regulations, we end up paying far more for the products and services we all need, and we disincent innovation. Lastly, Haidt says that social conservatives have an important insight that liberals rarely understand: by undermining certain traditional social structures, we sometimes end up hurting the people we are trying to help.</p><p>To build a healthy society, we should aim not to wipe out ideologies that differ from our own, but to recognize that each political group is made up of good people who have important things to say.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Haidt concludes the book by reminding the reader of the central metaphors in each section. In Part I, he explained that intuitions come first, reasoning second. He advises that as a souvenir from this section of the book, we should keep a vision of ourselves and everyone around us as tiny riders on massive elephants. In Part II, he explained that there is more to morality than harm and fairness. As a souvenir from this section, we should keep a healthy suspicion of anyone who claims there is a single morality that is appropriate for all societies at all times. Lastly, in Part III, he explained that we are 90 percent chimp, 10 percent bee. As a souvenir from this final section, we should keep the image of the hive switch, which can engage our moral emotions and enable us to become selfless parts of a greater whole.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Free Will (Sam Harris book)</h1><p>The thesis of Sam Harris’s book Free Will is that we don’t have it.</p><p>First: what <em>is</em> free will? Let’s say it’s some inner spark of agency that cannot be explained exogenously, i.e. isn’t just biology, physics, culture, law, random flukes, etc.</p><p>The argument starts with the observation that at minimum, we are much more constrained by these exogenous factors than we normally assume. Obviously we’re limited by the laws of physics and biology, but beyond that, surely our wills are free to do whatever? Not so fast. I might think to myself, “right now I <em>could</em> take any action that isn’t physically impossible.” But could I really? Could I break all the windows in my apartment? Could I throw my laptop at a passing truck? Could I moonwalk everywhere for the next week? Naively, I might say I simply <em>won’t</em> do those things because I anticipate negative consequences. But there’s also a sense in which I literally could not do those things. They are too incongruous with my needs and values. So, it shouldn’t be much of a stretch to accept the premise that all those exogenous factors at least <em>limit</em> us to some small set of likely actions. E.g. maybe I’ll read a book, or go for a walk, or scroll through Twitter, or call my mom.</p><p>Already we might ask ourselves: how free is this will, exactly, if it’s so constrained? But most people aren’t that extreme. As long as there’s <em>some</em> room for that inner spark of agency to guide us around in our cages, our wills are free enough. (Dennett basically argues this.) So, that apparent freedom to choose whether I’ll read a book or scroll through Twitter—is there an exogenous explanation for that too? Well, yeah, there are probably several. Maybe I woke up to a few notifications this morning that sucked me into Twitter. Maybe the book I’m currently reading happens to be a bit of a slog. Or maybe it’s a page-turner! Maybe my phone battery runs out and I pick up the book to entertain myself while my phone charges. Etc.</p><p>Now, what if we strip away all the environmental prompts—is there still free will underneath? Well, if I’m deciding between two options, I’m evaluating the options according to a utility function—something that maps the attributes of each option to the things I care about. Say I’m choosing which car to buy. I care about its price, its energy efficiency, its size, its appearance, etc. The question is: what determined how much I care about each of those variables? Where does my utility function come from? Alas, it came from exogenous factors! I didn’t <em>choose</em> to care about paying a fair price; I didn’t <em>choose</em> to care about conserving energy; I didn’t <em>choose</em> to care how often people compliment my sweet ride. All those values had external causes. Even if I arrived at some of those values via an internal reasoning process, I didn’t choose the meta-values by which I evaluated the conclusions of that process. I’m never the prime mover.</p><p>I think that lays out most of the theoretical argument, as I understand it. Harris also gives a bunch of examples that drive the intuition further. One that stood out to me is the story of Charles Whitman, the “Texas Sniper”, who in 1966 killed his mother and wife, then climbed a tower at the University of Texas and shot at random people for an hour and a half, killing a total of 17 people. Before doing all this he wrote a suicide note asking for his brain to be examined in an autopsy. Here’s part of the note:</p><blockquote><p>I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.</p></blockquote><p>It turned out that he had a pretty huge brain tumor, pressing against his amygdala. Harris suggested here that the tumor was an obviously indispensable part of the explanation for Whitman’s behavior, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman#Autopsy">not everyone agrees</a>. Anyway, the point is that some people do have neuropathologies that evidently affect their behavior. But where’s the line between neurology and neuropathology? Arguably, for all of us behavior is just “brain tumors all the way down.”</p><p>I won’t be surprised if you aren’t convinced by the argument I laid out here. For whatever reason <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1226609161892319232">I find it hard to talk about clearly</a>. But if you’re interested in the subject, I recommend the book! It’s short, engaging, and thought-provoking. You might also enjoy hearing Very Bad Wizards discuss it with Sam in <a href="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/59">this podcast episode</a>.</p></div>'

Thanks also to @nosilverv for suggesting the title of this post.</em></p><hr><p>Douglas Hofstadter’s 1979 masterpiece <a href="goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach"><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em></a> is notoriously hard to summarize. Its content is no less important than its form—in fact, its content is inextricable from its form. But here we will try to extricate it. Hofstadter would hate seeing these ideas strung out in an ugly skeleton, but even he would admit that most readers misinterpreted his book. In fact, he wrote a whole <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"><em>‘nuther</em> book</a> to clear up the confusion. (I have not read it, so it’s fully possible that I’m just as confused as the rest of them.)</p><p>I’ve attempted to write the core argument in <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/logical-and-critical-thinking/0/steps/9139">standardized form</a>. “P” stands for “premise”, and “C” stands for “conclusion”. Some of these claims are vague enough to be nearly meaningless, but that’s what you get when you try to compress 777 pages into 34 propositions and you’re not a genius. Here goes nothing:</p><p><strong>P1.</strong> The self is the part of the mind that is conscious.</p><p><strong>P2.</strong> The mind is a product of the brain.</p><p><strong>P3.</strong> The brain is composed of neurons.</p><p><strong>P4.</strong> All neuronal activity is either transmission or inhibition of electrical impulses.</p><p><strong>P5.</strong> Electrical impulses carry information.</p><p><strong>P6.</strong> Information is that which can be translated from one form to another, such that the original form could be deduced from the translated form, given a decoding mechanism.</p><p><strong>P7.</strong> The purest way to study the translation and decoding of information is by studying a <em>formal system</em>.</p><p><strong>P8.</strong> A formal system is comprised of <em>axioms</em>, which are strings of typographical symbols (such as letters), and <em>rules</em> for manipulating the axioms to produce <em>theorems</em>, which are new strings of symbols.</p><p><strong>P9.</strong> A formal system can be devised such that its typographical symbols correspond to logical or arithmetical words in human language, such as “and”, “or”, “not”, “plus”, “equals”, etc, and such that the axioms and rules produce theorems which, when interpreted on the level of human language, express only true statements of number theory—e.g. “2+2=4”, “13 is prime”, “1 /= 0”, etc. Hofstadter calls this system Typographical Number Theory (TNT).</p><p><strong>P10.</strong> The symbols of TNT can be arranged so as to <em>express</em> (when interpreted on the level of human language) false statements of number theory (such as 1+1=4), but we should not be able to ‘decode’ (i.e. ‘prove’) these statements by running the typographical rules backwards to reach the axioms of TNT, because TNT has been deliberately designed to exclude false number-theoretical statements from the range of possible theorems. In other words, TNT has been designed to be consistent (no provable statement is false) and complete (all true statements are provable).</p><p><strong>P11.</strong> Rules for manipulating strings of typographical symbols can do nothing but add, subtract, multiply, or replace typographical symbols.</p><p><strong>P12.</strong> The addition, subtraction, multiplication, or replacement of typographical symbols is precisely what arithmetical operations do.</p><p><strong>C13.</strong> Any formal system can be translated such that its symbols are expressed as numbers and its rules are expressed as arithmetical operations. (This technique is called Gödel-numbering, after the mathematician Kurt Gödel, who invented it. Every string of TNT has a Gödel number.) (by P11 and P12)</p><p><strong>P14.</strong> Two numbers can have a relationship where one is typographically identical to the end of the other—for example, ‘4’ is typographically identical to the end of ‘1234’.</p><p><strong>P15.</strong> Mathematical proofs can be expressed in TNT.</p><p><strong>P16.</strong> Mathematical proofs that can be expressed in TNT have Gödel numbers.</p><p><strong>P17.</strong> Mathematical proofs end with the statements they prove.</p><p><strong>C18.</strong> The Gödel number of a mathematical proof in TNT would end with the Gödel number of the statement it proves. For example, the proof “premise 1, premise 2, premise 3; therefore, conclusion” might have the Gödel number ‘1234’, and “conclusion” would have the Gödel number ‘4’. (by P14, P15, P16, and P17)</p><p><strong>P19.</strong> When two Gödel numbers exist such that one is a proof of the other, and the other is identical to the end of the proof (like ‘1234’ and ‘4’), these numbers can be called a Proof Pair.</p><p><strong>P20.</strong> Statements of number theory can have free variables. For example, “<em>a</em> = 1” has the free variable <em>a</em>.</p><p><strong>P21.</strong> Since it is possible to express “<em>a</em> = 1” as a Gödel number, it is possible to insert that Gödel number into “<em>a</em> = 1” as the free variable <em>a</em>. (A statement with a free variable is a bit like a predicate with no subject, like “is a sentence fragment.” What we’re proposing here is like saying “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment.” Hofstadter calls this self-referential sentence the <em>Arithmoquinification</em> of <em>a</em>. The word comes from two ideas:</p><ol><li>For a sentence to “quine” is for a sentence to quote itself, as in “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment” (after the logician Willard Van Orman Quine)</li><li>The “Arithmo” in “Arithmoquine” signifies that a string of symbols is quining, but arithmetically, as in the Gödel number for “‘<em>a</em> = 1’ = 1”.</li></ol><p><strong>P22.</strong> You can make the statement, “There are two numbers such that one is the Arithmoquinification of the other.” (Like saying, “there are two strings of words such that one is the quinification of the other” or “there is a sentence which quotes itself”). This statement, like all number-theoretical statements, has a Gödel number.</p><p><strong>P23.</strong> You can make the statement that “There are no two numbers such that a) they form a Proof Pair (i.e. one is the Gödel number of the conclusion of a proof whose Gödel number ends in that first number, as in ‘4’ and ‘1234’, hypothetically), and b) one is the Arithmoquinification of the other (i.e. one is the same as the other except that it has inserted itself into its free variable, as in “‘is a sentence fragment’ is a sentence fragment”).</p><p><strong>P24.</strong> The string of TNT-symbols that expresses the above statement (in P23) has a Gödel number, and it has a free variable (namely the first number in the statement in P22), which means it can be Arithmoquined (i.e. its free variable can be replaced by itself). (Uh oh.)</p><p><strong>P25.</strong> If you <em>do</em> Arithmoquine the statement in P23, then you get the following: “There is no Proof Pair ending in the Arithmoquinification of the statement in P23.”</p><p><strong>P26.</strong> The statement in P25 means, “There is no proof of this statement.”</p><p><strong>P27.</strong> In other words, “I am not provable in TNT.” (Note that we have not <em>derived</em> this statement from the axioms of TNT. We’ve only <em>expressed</em> it, with the faith that all theorems of TNT are true statements of number theory and that all true statements of number theory are theorems of TNT.)</p><p><strong>P28.</strong> But if “I am not provable in TNT” is <em>true</em>, then all true statements of number theory are not represented (i.e. provable) in the theorems of TNT.</p><p><strong>P29.</strong> And if “I am not provable in TNT” is <em>false</em>, then that precise statement must be provable in TNT, which means that not all theorems of TNT are true.</p><p><strong>C30.</strong> (And this is Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem:) Any formal system that is sufficiently sophisticated to express truths of number theory cannot be both consistent and complete. (That is, as soon as it gains the power to refer to itself, TNT explodes! #pun) (by P19-P29)</p><p><strong>P31.</strong> (And here’s where the airtightness of Hofstadter’s argument also explodes, but beautifully:) There is a deep, abstract likeness between a) the information that is carried and manipulated by neurons and b) the information that is carried and manipulated by the rules of a formal system.</p><p><strong>P32.</strong> Selfless ingredients, when subjected to sufficiently sophisticated rules of manipulation, acquire the ability to indirectly refer to themselves and the system which produces them.</p><p><strong>P33.</strong> The electrical signals in human brains (selfless ingredients) are subject to (surely highly sophisticated) rules of manipulation via neurons.</p><p><strong>C34.</strong> Perhaps our sense of self—our subjective experience of the world, our feeling that there is an “I” who is perceiving everything—emerges in our brains as inexorably as self-reference emerges out of formal systems such as TNT, and in an analogous way. (by C30, P31, P32, and P33)</p><p>It’s not exactly a <em>convincing</em> argument… but at least it makes you feel smart. Really though, GEB is more about beauty than it is about linear cogency. 6 out of 5 stars. Read it!</p></hr></div>'

I had never read a Western before, but I had heard that people get obsessed with this one, and I see why. McMurtry’s masterful use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech">free indirect style</a> allows you to fully inhabit the minds of each of his characters. Finishing the book is like saying goodbye to your friends. It’s rare for a book to make me cry or laugh, and Lonesome Dove made me do both.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Zero to One</h1><p>A few new perspectives from Peter Thiel’s book, Zero to One:</p><p>He thinks the future needs to be defined more by vertical progress (new technology — going from 0 to 1) than by horizontal progress (globalization — going from 1 to n). Vertical progress can only be achieved by monopolies, because any business that doesn’t capture its entire market ends up being relentlessly focused on short-term competition and survival. It has no resources left over for invention or long-term planning.</p><p>Monopolies are built on “secrets” — ideas that are true, and often obvious in hindsight, but that the mainstream isn’t even thinking about, let alone disagreeing with. (AirBnB: people will let complete strangers stay in their homes if the price is right.) Monopolies are usually the “last mover” in their domain: on some key dimension, their product is at least an order of magnitude better than the second best thing. This makes it impossible for competitors to catch up. Building a monopoly is not about disruption, and it’s not about substitution of human work. It’s more often about figuring out how to complement human strengths with the strengths of technology.</p><p>The core idea of the book is that competition is vastly overrated. It’s easy to model (think Econ 101) and easy to administer (think standardized tests), but ties everyone up in zero-sum status games. Thiel’s advice: don’t compete. Play games where you can create and recapture lots of value over long periods of time without needing to outsmart others.</p><p>The book is very short and conversational, and it tells story of the tech bubble in the 90s through the eyes of someone who was at the centre of the action. Even if its ideas don’t appeal to you, I’d say it’s worth reading just to better understand where we are today.</p></div>'
