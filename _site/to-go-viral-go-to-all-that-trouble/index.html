                <p>It seems like the key to making a creative project that goes viral is hard to execute but conceptually pretty simple: do something that makes people think “I can’t <em>believe</em> you went to all that trouble.” E.g. TikTok videos where people spend 12 hours trying to bounce a ping pong ball into a cup from across the room, then get 40 million views. You could do that! But you probably won’t, because, I mean…can you imagine going to all that trouble? Some specific examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alexey Guzey <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1195380402078265345">spent 130 hours</a> fact-checking Matthew Walker’s book “Why We Sleep”. (3300 likes on Twitter.)</li>
  <li>My friend Ben spent 140 hours meticulously cutting out paper letters to tell the story of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgIkxAfJsk">the history of typography</a>. (1.5 million views on YouTube.)</li>
  <li>My friend Matthew learned every single song on the piano and then performed them as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOM9vbB2nM8">medley</a>. (40,000 views on YouTube, then got to perform live with them!)</li>
  <li>MrBeast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWcldHxHFpo">counted to 100,000</a> in one video. (20 million views on YouTube.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that these people weren’t also demonstrating skill or exercising great judgment. It’s just that the virality is largely driven by the “can-you-imagine-going-to-all-that-trouble” factor. As Teller of the magician duo Penn &amp; Teller <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/teller-reveals-his-secrets-100744801/">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make the secret a lot more trouble than the trick seems worth. You will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest. My partner, Penn, and I once produced 500 live cockroaches from a top hat on the desk of talk-show host David Letterman. To prepare this took weeks. We hired an entomologist who provided slow-moving, camera-friendly cockroaches (the kind from under your stove don’t hang around for close-ups) and taught us to pick the bugs up without screaming like preadolescent girls. Then we built a secret compartment out of foam-core (one of the few materials cockroaches can’t cling to) and worked out a devious routine for sneaking the compartment into the hat. More trouble than the trick was worth? To you, probably. But not to magicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, for many people who do things like this, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyj612/status/1256410576244420609">it doesn’t <em>feel</em> like trouble to them</a>. They’re just doing what they enjoy.</p>
