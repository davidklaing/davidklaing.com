    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Atomic Habits</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-01-14</em><hr/><p>In an <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/north-star-podcast/daniel-gross-dreams-and-e8iC1HhrjDt/">episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell</a>, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was very wise:</p><blockquote><p>The definition of a habit, for me, is something that doesn’t require willpower. How can I build a large collection of habits that are healthy—that are correct—and save them to RAM in my head so that I don’t have to think about them? I would like to have that done by the end of my 20s. I’d like to be in a good place in terms of body composition, in terms of what I eat, in terms of how I work, so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about that stuff.</p></blockquote><p>I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and I got to thinking about which habits I might want to build or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear’s new book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits &amp; Build Good Ones</a>.</p><p>The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38 times better than when you started (\(1.01^{365} = 37.8\)). It’s often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible but consistent short-term differences. Hence, <em>atomic</em> habits: pennies that grow into a fortune.</p><p>Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cue</strong>. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.</li><li>The <strong>craving</strong>. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.</li><li>The <strong>response</strong>. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.</li><li>The <strong>reward</strong>. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.</li></ul><p>Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull to influence your behaviour. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear’s method.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>To build a good habit</th><th>To break a bad one</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cue</td><td>Make it obvious</td><td>Make it invisible</td></tr><tr><td>Craving</td><td>Make it attractive</td><td>Make it unattractive</td></tr><tr><td>Response</td><td>Make it easy</td><td>Make it hard</td></tr><tr><td>Reward</td><td>Make it satisfying</td><td>Make it unsatisfying</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you’ve done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then you might be familiar with many of these ideas already. This was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I think you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I’ll describe the ideas that I’ve implemented myself since reading it.</p><h2 id="habit-stacking">Habit stacking</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to start performing a new habit directly following another one that is already ingrained, you turn the old habit’s reward into the new habit’s cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven into your life.</p><p>Last year, I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. I’m more hydrated than ever.</p><h2 id="implementation-intentions">Implementation intentions</h2><p>In a study, two groups were asked to make to-do lists, but one group was given a small tweak that resulted in them accomplishing many more tasks than the other. They were told to write down with each task the time and location where they intended to complete it. They created an implementation intention. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious, this time by associating the action with a context that can be perceived as the cue.</p><p>I’ve started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card</em>, it’s <em>Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning</em>. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task has helped me cross a number of them off.</p><h2 id="prime-your-environment">Prime your environment</h2><p>I first learned the value of this lesson three years ago when I lived in a tiny coach house in Welland, Ontario. I had always struggled to get out of bed on time, but I was teaching courses of my own for the first time and couldn’t afford to be late for class. So I came up with a solution. Each night before bed, I prepared my stovetop espresso maker and put it on the stove, alongside a clean mug and my phone (my alarm). When my alarm started ringing, I had to get out of bed and walk over to the stove to turn it off. Immediately, I would turn on the stove element and go back to bed for a snooze. Ten minutes later I would be woken again by the gurgling of the espresso, as well as the fear that it would boil over if I didn’t get up to turn off the element. My reward for getting up the second time was a fresh cup of coffee. Ever since then I’ve been completely cured of my snoozing habit.</p><p>As Clear explains, priming your environment for its next use is a great way to make a desirable behaviour more obvious as well as easier. After reflecting on this, I’ve been experimenting with a few changes:</p><ul><li>Pumping up my bike tires as soon as I get home from my evening bike commute. (This makes it easier to choose the bike as my mode of transport the next day.)</li><li>Repacking my gym bag as soon as I get home from the gym. (This makes it easier to go for a work-out whenever I feel like it.)</li><li>Filling up a big water jug next to my desk at the end of each work day. (This makes it easier to stay hydrated the next day. Note that putting the water jug there also makes my drinking habit more obvious.)</li><li>Placing a novel on my pillow after making my bed each morning. (I’m trying to build the habit of reading fiction before bed because I find that it helps me sleep.)</li></ul><h2 id="make-it-small">Make it small</h2><p>I’ve used various habit trackers for about four years now, and I’ve just about settled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.tasklife&amp;hl=en">TaskLife</a> as my favourite. I define a list of behaviours, and each day the app asks me whether I’ve done them. The beauty of it is that I can choose the frequency with which I want to perform each task, as well as the time period over which to calculate that frequency. It’s like Andy Matuschak’s system of <a href="http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/169043084412/successful-habits-through-smoothly-ratcheting">smoothly ratcheting targets with teeth</a>, minus a bit of smoothness and all the teeth.</p><p>The most common reason that I’ve failed to hit my target frequency has been the size of my tasks—they have been too hard. For example, it’s often hard to find the time and motivation for one full hour of writing, so I would often skip that habit. Even before reading Atomic Habits, I had recognized this problem and made some changes, like cutting 60 minutes of writing down to 10. But Clear offered many more ways to break down a complex or challenging behaviour into a task that can be completed in under two minutes. Since getting started is by far the hardest part of most habits, I decided to change all my habits in TaskLife to 2-minutes-or-under tasks as a way of making it easier to spend time on the things that matter to me. Here is the current list of questions that TaskLife asks me each morning about my previous day, along with the frequency with which I aim to complete those tasks over a rolling window of 21 days:</p><ul><li>Did you study at least one flashcard? (70%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of fiction? (70%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence? (55%)</li><li>Did you read at least one <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> article? (50%)</li><li>Did you play at least one chord on the guitar? (50%)</li><li>Did you write at least one sentence in your journal? (50%)</li><li>Did you go to bed by 9:30pm? (50%)</li><li>Did you send at least one message to a friend? (50%)</li><li>Did you read at least one page of nonfiction? (40%)</li><li>Did you walk through the doors of the gym? (25%)</li></ul><h2 id="automate-it">Automate it</h2><p>Lastly, the easiest way to make a task easier is to delegate it to a machine. As a data scientist, I have obviously implemented this one before, too. I’ve automated my health insurance payments, my donations to charity, my bus pass top-ups, my <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">memorization efforts</a>, my <a href="https://www.fitbit.com">sleep tracking, my exercise tracking</a>, and my rebalancing calculations in my investment accounts. But there are always more things to automate, and Clear’s chapter on the subject got me to reflect on what else I could do. Since reading the chapter, I’ve set up automatic payments on all of my regular bills, and on my to-do list (with an implementation intention!) is the task of setting up automatic monthly transfers into my investment accounts.</p><p>In summary, I highly recommend Atomic Habits. If the topic of habit formation is new to you, I think this book is probably the best general resource you’ll find. And if the topic is already familiar, you’ll find that the book is a quick and engaging read with dozens of fresh ideas that you can consider implementing in your life.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Communication in data science is more than just the final report</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2017-11-10</em><hr/><p><em>Cross-posted from the <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-11-10-DSCI-542-communication/">UBC MDS blog</a></em>.</p><hr><p>When people stress the importance of good communication in data science, they are usually saying something like what Hadley Wickham says in his book <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html">R for Data Science</a>: “[It] doesn’t matter how great your analysis is unless you can explain it to others: you need to communicate your results.” In other words, good communication is crucial to data science because it is the final step, without which all prior work would be wasted.</p><p>But communication is even more important than that. If you fail to communicate well with your client at the beginning of a project, you may waste your efforts answering the wrong question. If you fail to communicate well with your team, you may create inefficiencies in your workflow. And if you fail to communicate well with your future self, through careful documentation and clean code, you may find yourself circling back to redo old work. Communication is of course important at the end of the project too, but it’s more than just a final bottleneck; it’s important at every stage.</p><p>I had in mind this view of communication in data science when I designed DSCI 542: Communication &amp; Argumentation, a four-week course that students take in their first month of the UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program. My goal was to prepare students for the wide variety of communication-related challenges they will face as data scientists. This was hard because these challenges vary in so many ways – by medium, by audience, by purpose. One day you’re explaining a new algorithm to your manager; another day you’re messaging a co-worker over Slack to try to fix a bug; another day you’re presenting the results of your analysis to a room full of decision-makers. So, rather than trying to prescribe specific strategies for communicating well in every conceivable scenario, I aimed to help the students discover a few key principles that apply across all data science communication.</p><p>The most important of these principles is a consequence of what psychologists call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge</a>: the fact that when you know something, it is nearly impossible to imagine what it is like not to know it. In a classic experiment, subjects are privately told the title of a popular song, and asked to clap (but not sing or hum) its chorus. They then predict whether another person in the room, who wasn’t told the title of the song, would be able to guess it. Time and again, the people who clap the song overestimate other people’s ability to guess it. The clapper can hear the music in their head; the listener can hear only a disconnected, rhythmic skeleton.</p><p>Because of the curse of knowledge, a communicator’s first instinct is often to provide their audience with precise but abstract details about the subject at hand. The communicator queries their own mind for the phrase, “confidence interval”, and they come up with something like, “an interval estimate of a parameter of a statistical model.” This is fine if the audience already knows what a confidence interval is, but it’s gibberish if they don’t. Herein lies the biggest challenge in communication. It’s not enough to simply understand a subject and be able to produce true sentences about it. A skilled communicator must be able to craft each part of their message in anticipation of the audience’s state of mind.</p><p>So, what is the principle here? “Know about the curse of knowledge, and don’t let it get you”? Unfortunately, naming the problem is not the same as solving it. In our class this year, the best solution that the students and I discovered was to explain concepts from the bottom up rather than from the top down. Let me show you two examples to illustrate what I mean. Here is a top-down explanation of the difference between statistics and probability:</p><blockquote><p>Statistical inference aims to characterize data-generating processes, usually based on samples of observations. In contrast, probabilistic inference aims to determine how likely it is that an event will occur. While statistical inference works backward from data to say something about the conditions that produced it, probabilistic inference works forward from a supposed set of conditions to predict which data will be produced next.</p></blockquote><p>A top-down explanation provides information that is mentally proximate to the concept. The information is general and abstract – a Platonic approach.</p><p>In contrast, here is a bottom-up explanation:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose I have a bag that contains 1000 balls, and each ball is either blue or red. If I know the proportion of balls that are red, then I can compute the probability that a randomly selected ball will turn out to be red. But if I don’t know the proportion of red balls, I will have to estimate it through repeated samples, using statistics. Probabilistic inference uses my assumptions to predict my observations; statistical inference uses my observations to refine my assumptions.</p></blockquote><p>A bottom-up explanation starts with examples, allowing the abstraction and generality to emerge out of concreteness and specificity.</p><p>There are tradeoffs between these approaches, of course. Top-down explanations are useful within intellectual communities because they make it easier to build on prior abstractions. But data science is so interdisciplinary, and has so much contact with people outside the field, that bottom-up explanations are almost always best.</p><p>Throughout the four weeks of the course, we examined other communication-related challenges that frequently occur across data science work:</p><ul><li>how to be an effective consumer of data science communication</li><li>how to apply principles of narrative, and how to reason about its risks</li><li>how spot the advantages and disadvantages of a given medium of communication, such as prose, speech, code, or mathematical notation</li><li>how to connect the statistical language of variables and values to the practical concerns of decision-makers</li><li>how to connect the quantified form of uncertainty that results from statistical modelling to the subjective form of uncertainty that people experience in everyday life</li></ul><p>It was a privilege to teach this course. The students approached the lessons and assignments with enthusiasm and insight, and I am proud of what they achieved. I hope that they will begin their data science careers with not just the ability to share the results of their analyses, but with the ability to approach all data science communication with sound strategies and a good understanding of the principles at play.</p></hr></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>If you’re good, you need to talk more</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-07-09</em><hr/><p>One evening last fall, I was invited to play a board game called <a class="external-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-Avalon-Social-Deduction-Game/dp/B009SAAV0C" target="_self">Avalon</a>. The game is a contest between a good team and a bad team. Through a series of public and private votes and discussion at the table, the bad people try to masquerade as good, while the good try to figure out who is good and who is bad.</p><p>I was assigned to the good team. I was the only one in the group who had never played before, so I took a backseat for the first few rounds, speaking little. To my surprise, this caused many players to suspect that I was bad.</p><p>“If you’re good,” <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/kevinakwok" target="_self">one of them</a> said to me, “you need to talk more.”</p><p>I protested that bad people can speak just as easily as good people. How could I convince other players to trust me when any word I said might be a lie?</p><p>What I had failed to understand was that because of the burden of deception, talking is much more cognitively demanding for the bad people than for the good. It’s hard to maintain a consistent lie over the course of the whole game. This means that the best strategy for those on the good team is to consistently share their own thoughts and solicit those of all others. Not only does this shine a harsh light on the liars, but it also makes a greater amount of true information available for all good players to reason with.</p><p><em>If you’re good, you need to talk more.</em> I’ve come to realize that this idea goes far beyond the game of Avalon. In many facets of our lives, we draw from and contribute to an epistemic commons—a shared set of beliefs and norms that help us predict and understand the world and each other. In each facet, whether familial, social, professional, or civic, our lives are better when the epistemic commons is filled with true beliefs and productive norms. In fact, a healthy commons, with its high levels of mutual trust and perceived alignment, has the power to make our lives <em>much</em> better. Consider the expressive freedom and the unguardedness that were unlocked in the blossoming of your closest friendships.</p><p>But there are many ways the epistemic commons can become unhealthy. Like in Avalon, many groups of people contain bad actors who corrupt the commons for their own gain. Not only that, but the commons can degrade even without bad actors, simply because the world is complex and ever-changing. Ideas don’t have to be true to be catchy, and so misconceptions can spread through the commons like viruses.</p><p>What I came to understand after playing Avalon that night is that the health of an epistemic commons is maintained only under the active stewardship of good people—people who want to discover the truth and share it, who want their communities to operate under norms that allow everyone to flourish.</p><p>You might say that good stewardship isn’t so much about talking more as it is knowing when <em>not</em> to talk. You might say that it is often ineffectual, and sometimes counterproductive, to opine on subjects in which you are uninformed or undecided. Many of us have internalized the idea that we need to do our homework and think through our positions carefully before sharing, so that we don’t waste everyone’s time and attention.</p><p>I can certainly empathize with this view. If you’re like me, you often attend work meetings in which you feel doubtful of arguments people make. In these meetings I find it challenging to speak my mind, especially when I need to expend a lot of energy just to understand other people’s perspectives, let alone feel confident in my own.</p><p>But I have learned, through feedback and experience, that the less confident I am in my opinion, the <em>more</em> important it is for me to speak up. I think this is because when I’m feeling uncertain, it’s likely that other people are too. The more confident voices tend to dominate the conversation, and everyone else tends to nod along or just sit in silence. It’s far better to say “I don’t think I agree with this view, but I need some time to think about why” than to say nothing and <em>then</em> go off and do your homework. Silence is tacit agreement with the consensus. Revealing your uncertainty in real time helps to forestall harmful misunderstandings.</p><p>Moreover, whatever thoughts and ideas you do have, even if they are insufficient to solve the problem at hand, can provide scaffolding for others to find a solution. Assuming that others are searching for mutually beneficial ideas, why not provide them with as much data as possible?</p><p>Not everyone should adopt the “talk more” philosophy, of course. But I think many people are like me: they tend to err on the side of undersharing rather than oversharing. So, to those people: if you’re good, you need to talk more! Here are some concrete ways I’m doing this in my own life:</p><ol><li>Making an effort to be as open and responsive as possible with loved ones: reaching out more, responding faster, expressing dissatisfaction more readily, and offering praise whenever it occurs to me. I don’t think I had problems in this area before, but I believe that explicitly aspiring to this behavior has made me a better friend and partner.</li><li>Redistributing speaking time to quieter people when group conversations become lopsided. I’ve heard it said that if you’re in a conversation with one other person you should aim to speak 50% of the time. This generalizes well: in a conversation with five people, speak 20% of the time; with ten people, 10%; etc. When the Gini coefficient gets too high, be a conversational Robin Hood.</li><li>Being more vocal at work: speaking up more in meetings, writing more thorough documentation, leaving more detailed comments in code reviews, and sharing links that are relevant to company projects in the #random Slack channel. I work at a startup that seems poised to do big things, so I think my communicativeness within the company is one of the best opportunities I currently have to make a difference in the world.</li><li>Participating more actively on Twitter. This means writing more Tweets of my own, responding more frequently to others, and being more liberal in my use of the ‘like’ button. Like anyone, I need to be careful not to get too engrossed by social media, but having put some effort into curating my feed, I find that Twitter is a predominantly positive thing in my life.</li><li>Writing more blog posts<strong>.</strong> Writing takes a lot of work, and more often than not, what I write doesn’t bring me much recognition. But occasionally I hear a word or two of thanks for sharing an idea that helped or stimulated someone, and this is enough to convince me that my efforts are worthwhile.</li></ol><p>The sixth is still aspirational, but will hopefully be realized soon: play Avalon again! I’ve bought the game, but have yet to take the initiative to bring together enough people to play. Beyond the fact that it’s an absolute blast, I’ve been told there’s an additional benefit to playing regularly: you learn what it looks like when a person is trying to sabotage the commons rather than nourish it.</p><p>Luckily, real life is rarely as adversarial as Avalon, so we don’t usually need to be so suspicious of those around us. But I know of no experience that better demonstrates the challenges of collaborative truth-seeking, and the responsibility of good people to talk more.</p><hr><p>Thanks to Kevin Kwok for inspiring this post and for his insightful feedback on it.
