                <p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p>

<p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m working on a novel.”</p>

  <p>“Cool, what’s it about?”</p>

  <p>“It’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, you mean like a fanfic?”</p>

  <p>“No, I’m telling the story of Harry’s first year at Hogwarts.”</p>

  <p>“But you’re not putting a spin on it or anything?”</p>

  <p>“Nope, it’s the same as the story told in the original.”</p>

  <p>“Word for word?”</p>

  <p>“No, but arc for arc. Rowling’s story, my words.”</p>

  <p>“Huh. Sort of like a cover.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. I’m not talking about adaptations, like Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By “covers”, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other people’s written works—comprehensive paraphrases.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. When you’re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. That’s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p>

<p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menand’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson “used to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that way”.</li>
  <li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, “I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.”</li>
  <li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwell’s essay, “Politics and the English Language”. He says in an introductory comment, “The following is my attempt to update George Orwell’s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. I’ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original author’s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p>

<p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientists’ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefs’ recipes; painters reproduce other painters’ paintings. If you’re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writer’s work? I’ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a id="deep-laziness" class="internal-link" href="/deep-laziness/">Deep Laziness — Sarah Perry</a></li>
  <li><a id="solved-conversations" class="internal-link" href="/solved-conversations/">Solved conversations — Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li>
  <li><a id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process" class="internal-link" href="/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/">Research as a stochastic decision process — Jacob Steinhardt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough “original”<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I don’t have to worry about writer’s block. If my own ideas aren’t flowing, I can just cover someone else’s.</p>

<hr />

<p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it weren’t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/">potentially even better</a> in English than in Liu Cixin’s original Chinese.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey">The Odyssey</a>, translated by Emily Wilson. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/best-book-2018.html">Says</a> Tyler Cowen, “It is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&amp;q=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.">strong reviews</a> from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.”</li>
</ul>

<p>2. As Veerasamy pointed out to me when I asked him about his cover of Orwell, even original creations are really just “assemblages of micro-covers” anyway. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc">Everything is a Remix</a>.</p>

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Deep Laziness — Sarah Perry</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-10-09</em><hr/><p>Laziness is usually frowned upon. We get paid, thanked, and admired for <em>producing</em>: for transforming chaos into order, for giving more than we take, for creating value rather than consuming it. Society doesn’t reward us for slacking off.</p><p>But not all laziness is bad. The kind of laziness we frown upon is shallow—guilt-ridden and opportunistic, like when we take a too-long break from work while scrolling through social media. Shallow laziness is the kind that you can’t quite settle into. But there is another flavor of laziness that is worth aspiring to—a kind that is wholesome, even exquisite. I’ve started referring to it as <em>deep</em> laziness, after reading Sarah Perry’s <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/06/deep-laziness/">post</a> on the subject.</p><p>To be deeply lazy is to be truly settled. Mainly, it is to eliminate the distance between your ideal and your actual self. It is not so much about relaxation or effort as it is about the absence of internal conflict. Where shallow laziness is failing to check the time and showing up late, deep laziness is walking exactly as slowly as you want to because you know you’re on time. Where shallow laziness is ordering pizza for the third night in a row, deep laziness is knowing how to make an easy and healthy meal that you love. Where shallow laziness is aimlessly browsing the internet all weekend, deep laziness is cozying up and watching the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy because you know that nothing else would make you happier.</p><p>These examples may suggest that deep laziness is a simple matter of getting your shit together enough that you can be self-assured in your indulgences. But it involves more than that. Perry recommends that we start by identifying the handful of behaviors that come to us most naturally, and then slowly elaborate on those behaviors in ways that preserve and reinforce the desirable feelings that the behaviors elicit.</p><p>For example, last year I started playing online <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Blitz">blitz chess</a>. The feeling that chess elicits for me is that of flow, a state of immersive focus on a problem. Flow is one of the feelings I enjoy the most, so in pursuit of deep laziness, I have slowly made a series of modifications to my chess-playing habits, both in my style of play and in the sub-variants of blitz that I play most often. Each of these modifications has made chess a better source of flow for me. As a result I feel more like my true self, more deeply lazy for chess’s presence in my life.</p><p>The point is not to do more things that elicit flow, per se, although I expect that many of you readers are like me in that flow is one of the feelings you pursue the most. The point is to reflect on the things you do when you’re bored, and ask, “what feeling am I chasing when I do this thing?” Having answered that question, you can let your behaviors evolve toward a richer, more resonant eliciting of that feeling.</p><p>Deep laziness is not deciding abstractly what sort of person to be, and then imposing your behaviors from the top down. Deep laziness is constructing yourself from the bottom up; it’s taking the self-enriching behaviors that are already present, and gradually deepening the grooves that they carve through your days.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Research as a stochastic decision process — Jacob Steinhardt</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-11-20</em><hr/><p>How can you maximize your impact across a set of potential projects? Arguably, the most important thing is to discover as quickly as possible which projects are dead ends. <strong>The more efficiently you can rule out unviable projects, the more time you free up for viable ones.</strong> This is the main insight of Jacob Steinhardt’s essay, <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html">Research as a Stochastic Decision Process</a>.</p><p>Steinhardt’s thesis is doubly important if, like for many people, a minority of your completed projects are responsible for a majority of your overall impact. You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, or the 80/20 rule, which states that in many systems, the majority of the outputs come from a minority of the inputs. Here is a nice visualization (from <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-pareto-principle-and-the-rule-of-thirds-6ae9d39ffc2a">Khe Hy</a>):</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/research_stochastic/pareto.png"/></p><p>Suppose that your projects follow this pattern too: most are punts, and few are home runs. Suppose also that you can’t predict the impact of a specific project; you only know that home runs are rare. Under these assumptions, it pays to complete as many projects as possible so as to maximize your chances of hitting a home run. That’s why it’s so important to figure out as efficiently as possible whether you are working on a project that is unfeasible, so that if it is you can move on to a new one.</p><p>How can you accomplish this? The key is to correctly prioritize the essential tasks for each project. Say you’re a psychologist and you have an idea for a study. Like all projects, this involves a set of essential tasks that you must complete for the project to succeed. For example:</p><ul><li>Recruit participants.</li><li>Hire assistants.</li><li>Book a space.</li><li>Get ethics approval.</li></ul><p>If this project is to fail for reasons outside your control, you want to minimize sunk costs. To this end, you can ask a guiding question about each task: how likely is this task to fail, relative to how long it will take to complete? The more likely a task is to fail, and the less time it will take to complete, the more you should prioritize it. Let’s ask this question of each of the tasks above:</p><ul><li>Recruit participants.    <ul><li>Very likely to succeed, and should take a few hours of focus.</li></ul></li><li>Hire assistants.    <ul><li>Likely to succeed, and should take a few days of focus.</li></ul></li><li>Book a space.    <ul><li>Very likely to succeed, and should take a few minutes of focus.</li></ul></li><li>Get ethics approval.    <ul><li>Uncertain whether it will succeed, and should take a few hours of focus.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In this case, your first priority should be to get ethics approval. Since there is uncertainty about whether you will even be approved to perform this experiment, you should find this out before spending time on surefire tasks like hiring assistants and recruiting participants. In Steinhardt’s words, prioritize tasks that are “most informative per unit time”.</p><p>Of course, this advice doesn’t apply only to researchers. It applies to all forms of production. Recruiters sourcing candidates, salespeople closing deals, teachers creating lessons, writers writing articles—we can all benefit by terminating our unviable projects sooner.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Solved conversations — Aaron Z. Lewis</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-10-23</em><hr/><p>Some conversations feel more like scripted dialogues than like improvised exchanges. Perhaps we’re lazily rehashing the same talking points for the hundredth time, like when we comment on the weather or complain about politicians. Regardless of their context, these conversations proceed like clockwork, surprising no one.</p><p>Aaron Z. Lewis refers to these as <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2014/06/01/solved-conversations/">“solved” conversations</a>, making an analogy with the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game">solved game</a>. A solved game, such as tic-tac-toe or connect-four, is one in which it is possible to compute the optimal move at every turn, causing the result to be perfectly predictable. Solved games are not much fun to play, since we always know what will happen next. Solved conversations, for the same reason, are not much fun to have.</p><p>Continuing the analogy, Lewis wonders whether we could have better conversations by asking what makes certain games solvable. He points out that the main feature of a solvable game is that it provides complete and perfect information to the players, as in checkers or chess. There can be no dice to roll, no hands to conceal, and no deals to negotiate. Therefore, Lewis suggests that we add more metaphorical rolls of the dice to our conversations—”un-solve” them by injecting uncertainty.</p><p>This recommendation makes sense in many cases. To me, however, solved conversations are not just ones that bore us because they’re too predictable. They also include conversations that are sure bets for satisfying a recurring need. One example is smalltalk, which satisfies the need for a reliable and inoffensive way to engage with just about anyone. Another example is when romantic partners tell each other “I love you” every day. These short conversations, which are just as simple as a game of tic-tac-toe, are important rituals in many of our relationships. We shouldn’t feel the need to reinvent the wheel every time we want to say hello or reaffirm our commitment to each other.</p><p>Solved conversations also include ones that have accomplished their purpose once and for all. Perhaps you’ve come to a tough decision—say, about where to go for next year’s vacation. Or perhaps you’ve clarified an ambiguity—say, about a project milestone that you and a colleague were interpreting differently. Whatever the challenge, your conversation has accomplished it, so there’s no need to have that conversation again. If you find yourself rehashing a conversation that has been solved in this sense, there’s no need to spice things up. Instead you should stop, remind yourself of the conclusion you reached previously, and then have a new conversation.</p><p>I take Lewis’s point that many of our conversations would be more meaningful if we engaged with them more creatively. The most meaningful conversations are undoubtedly the unsolved, and perhaps unsolvable, ones—the heated arguments, the late-night bull sessions, the neverending message threads about nothing in particular. These conversations are like Poker, Monopoly, or Risk. But I don’t think solved conversations are all bad. In many cases, like the familiar rhythm of a game of tic-tac-toe, simplicity is their virtue.</p></div>'
