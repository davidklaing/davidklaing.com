After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAhHDEtTD0">this vlogbrothers video</a>, I started referring to this standard as my ‘aesthetic target’. At its center is my ‘aesthetic bullseye’, which represents my concept of perfection.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/one_target.png"/></p><p>It’s tempting to remain unsatisfied until I hit my aesthetic bullseye. However, if I’m making something for others to enjoy, I need to consider their tastes as well as my own. And while this might seem to make my job harder, it actually makes it much easier. The reason is that not everyone’s tastes are exactly the same. If I superimpose other people’s aesthetic targets onto my own, my aesthetic bullseye disappears.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/multiple_targets.png"/></p><p>Even if I hit my own bullseye, I will miss the bullseyes of others. Realizing this has helped me to relax more when I’m struggling to achieve my own standard of perfection. Better to take more shots in the right general direction than to get caught in the perfectionist’s eternal refrain of “ready, aim, aim, aim, aaaaaaim…”</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>How to invest in index funds, for Canadians</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-02-11</em><hr/><p>Several friends have told me that they’ve read enough about investing to know that it’s best for non-professional investors to use index funds. But they don’t know how. Like, literally: what buttons should they press? I’m not a financial advisor, but here’s a system that works for me, as a Canadian:</p><p>1. Open a self-directed tax-free savings account (TFSA) with TD: <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/tfsa-accounts/">https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/tfsa-accounts/</a></p><p>The TFSA is a great place to start because you invest after-tax income, and can withdraw tax-free. There’s nothing fancy: you just put money in, then invest, and withdraw when you want to.</p><p>2. Transfer some money into your account. I don’t know the easiest way to do this if you don’t also have a checking account with TD, but if you do, you can do it on the transfers page on EasyWeb:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/transfer.png"/></p><p>3. Now that you’ve added some money, go to your TFSA in WebBroker: <a href="https://webbroker.td.com">https://webbroker.td.com</a></p><p>4. Click Buy/Sell at the top of the screen:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/buy_sell.png"/></p><p>5. On the pop-up, go to Mutual Funds:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/mutual_funds.png"/></p><p>6. Decide on your portfolio: what proportion of your investments will go into which funds? Mine is adapted from the model portfolios on Canadian Couch Potato, a site that I think is the best source of information about passive investing for Canadians. Here’s the site: <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com">https://canadiancouchpotato.com</a></p><p>And here are the model portfolios for the TD e-Series funds, which are the ones I invest in: <a href="https://cdn.canadiancouchpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCP-Model-Portfolios-TD-e-Series-2019.pdf">https://cdn.canadiancouchpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCP-Model-Portfolios-TD-e-Series-2019.pdf</a></p><p>If your investment horizon is shorter (i.e. you want to withdraw this money in the next few years), choose a portfolio that has more bonds relative to stocks. If your horizon is longer, choose one with more stocks relative to bonds.</p><p>Personally, I have a shorter horizon for my TFSA (which I think of as down payment money) and a longer horizon for my RSP (which I think of as retirement money). So I have different portfolios for each.</p><p>I invest in more American and international stocks than Canadian ones, simply because those markets are larger and I want to avoid “home bias”—the tendency for investors to invest in companies from their own countries. But the best allocation for me is not necessarily the best one for you. To reiterate: I’m not a financial advisor, and if you feel more comfortable just following Canadian Couch Potato’s advice, you should do that. Really though, do your research and think it through.</p><p>If you’re interested, here’s the breakdown for my TFSA, which is quite conservative since it’s shorter-term:</p><ul><li>10% cash</li><li>15% Canadian stock index (TDB900)</li><li>20% International stock index (TDB911)</li><li>25% US stock index (TDB902)</li><li>30% Canadian bond index (TDB909)</li></ul><p>And here’s the breakdown for my RSP, which is more aggressive since it’s long-term:</p><ul><li>0% cash</li><li>20% Canadian stock index (TDB900)</li><li>30% International stock index (TDB911)</li><li>40% US stock index (TDB902)</li><li>10% Canadian bond index (TDB909)</li></ul><p>7. After deciding on your portfolio, calculate how much of your cash to invest in each fund. You can whip out your calculator and just calculate the percentages every time if you want, but:</p><p>Personally, I use a spreadsheet to rebalance my portfolio every time I add more cash. Feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OWwhZ3SmQ4fmUzL-OpPVEaLibobMznyUdAFXwQIeLn0/copy">make a copy</a> of the template, if you want to use it. Edit the values under “Current Amount” and “Target Percentage”, and everything else will update automatically.</p><p>8. Go back to the Buy &amp; Sell page on WebBroker, and search for the first fund in your list. For example:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/search_fund.png"/></p><p>9. For “Quantity type”, choose “Dollar Amount”:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/quantity_type.png"/></p><p>10. Enter the amount from the “Delta” column if you’re using my spreadsheet template, or just add however much you want to invest in this particular fund. ($100 is the minimum amount for each of these funds.)</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/enter_amount.png"/></p><p>11. Click “Preview order”, then “Agree &amp; Send Order”:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/send_order.png"/></p><p>12. Profit!</p><p>This system obviously isn’t for everyone, but if you’re a Canadian who has found this stuff a bit out of reach, I hope this post has demystified a few parts of it for you.</p><p>One last time: I am not a financial advisor, and I am definitely not <em>your</em> financial advisor. But if you have any questions on the level of this nuts &amp; bolts stuff, or about my experience investing in the e-Series funds with TD’s self-directed accounts, I’m happy to help!</p><p>(PS: I know all this stuff because I’m fortunate to have a dad who worked at TD and who showed me how to do it. It’s all pretty simple once you’ve done it, but highly non-obvious if you haven’t.)</p></div>'

I think people who are drawn to PhD programs should consider whether they can assemble the key ingredients on their own.</p><p>As far as I can tell, these are the key ingredients:</p><ol><li>A broad understanding of the history and methods of your discipline, and a deep, constantly renewing understanding of a specialty within that discipline.</li><li>Several peer-reviewed publications.</li><li>Frequent feedback from an expert mentor over a period of several years.</li><li>Extensive experience teaching and evaluating beginners.</li><li>Completion and publication of a large research project that makes an original contribution.</li></ol><p>None of these things are easy to do outside a PhD program, but they’re all possible. You can learn independently: materials are abundant and usually free, so in many disciplines the only barriers to understanding are time and discipline. You can publish papers in industry journals or conference proceedings. You can find an expert mentor. You can volunteer to lead workshops, or find a part-time teaching position. And as long as you can acquire the tools and the data, you can do original research.</p><p>Of course, people consider doing PhDs for different reasons. Different end-goals may call for different mixtures of ingredients. But if you’re considering one at all, it’s worth asking yourself: for whichever parts of the experience are most appealing to you, is there a DIY version that might be just as good?</p><p>See also <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/phd">Nadia Eghbal’s essay, “Reimagining the PhD”</a>.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Professional development in data science</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-06-25</em><hr/><p>There are lots of great resources that help data scientists land their first job, or learn about specific subjects. But I haven’t seen any that focus on long-term professional development. This is how I’m currently thinking about it.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-goal">What is the goal?</h2><p>In a sense, the goal is constant improvement, but not just so that you can make more money or pass a test. It’s about continuously breathing new life into your self-efficacy—giving yourself increasingly strong evidence that you can take on more responsibility and be more ambitious.</p><p>You’re lucky if you can get this evidence in an organic way through the work you’re already doing. But I have the impression that many data scientists, like me, eventually start to worry that certain skills are atrophying and that they are becoming over-specialized or complacent.</p><h2 id="what-should-you-focus-on">What should you focus on?</h2><p>If you want to continually increase your self-efficacy, I think there are four areas to focus on:</p><ol><li>Concepts</li><li>Skills</li><li>Tools</li><li>Resources</li></ol><p>My suggestion is that you should try not to neglect any one of these categories for too long. If you go a whole year without making an active effort to increase your conceptual understanding, something is probably missing. But at the same time, you don’t need to constantly work on them all in parallel. One or another might be more or less rewarding depending on your mood at a given time. Think of them like directions on a joystick.</p><h3 id="1-concepts">1. Concepts</h3><p>Concepts are about what you know. Think:</p><ul><li>Bias-variance tradeoff</li><li>Central limit theorem</li><li>Curse of dimensionality</li><li>Bayes’ theorem</li></ul><p>Ideally, you are constantly deepening your knowledge of fundamental concepts, and branching out to new ones that interest you. Some people do this by regularly reading papers or textbooks that force them to call fundamentals to mind. It’s a good approach (much better than nothing!), but for me it lacks something crucial: testing yourself explicitly on your understanding.</p><p>I see two main ways to test yourself. One is through a spaced repetition practice, using software like Anki to help you stay sharp. The other is communication: explaining concepts to others through writing or speaking. I’m especially excited by the prospect of evergreen note-taking as a practice for engaging more deeply with data science concepts. If you haven’t heard of this idea, check out Andy Matuschak’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C">notes</a> on it.</p><h3 id="2-skills">2. Skills</h3><p>Skills are about what you can do. Think:</p><ul><li>Wrangle data</li><li>Run statistical tests</li><li>Write software packages</li><li>Create data visualizations</li><li>Train and validate models</li></ul><p>Again, the idea is constantly go deeper on fundamental skills and go broader on ones that interest you.</p><p>I see two main approaches to improving skills. One is to work on projects—ideally ones that are meaningful to you. The other is to regularly work through targeted exercises, like on Project Euler or Brilliant. The key is that you’re <em>doing</em> something.</p><p>When developing skills, it’s also worth asking whether targeted practice might be a bit overrated relative to the pursuit of tacit knowledge—the kind of know-how that can’t be (or isn’t) expressed in words. Cedric Chin has a great series of essays on this: https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/</p><h3 id="3-tools">3. Tools</h3><p>Tools are about what you use to do the things you do. Think:</p><ul><li>Specific programming languages</li><li>Packages</li><li>IDEs</li></ul><p>It’s hard to say whether there even <em>are</em> fundamentals when it comes to tools, since they change year by year. But you shouldn’t ignore them. There’s overlap here with concepts and skills—e.g. becoming a better Python programmer involves both learning new Python concepts and writing more Python code. So you can use spaced repetition, communication, projects, or targeted exercises. The key is to not neglect your tools as a subject of your learning.</p><h3 id="4-resources">4. Resources</h3><p>Resources are about what you reference when you haven’t stored important information in your brain. Think:</p><ul><li>Textbooks</li><li>Online courses</li><li>Cheatsheets</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>Wikis</li></ul><p>The goal here is to build yourself a “second brain”, to borrow Tiago Forte’s phrase. Improving your familiarity with data science resources is probably the easiest way to improve your professional self-efficacy, because it requires little effort but is a force multiplier for your efforts in learning about concepts, skills, and tools. Essentially, you want to build yourself a central repository of the best resources on every relevant topic, so that you always know where to go to find information that you haven’t memorized or to refresh your understanding on material that you feel rusty on.</p></div>'

It’s called the “slip-box” method, so named because it originally comprised a literal box into which the notetaker would slip index cards.</p><p>The method excites me for two reasons. One: it’s a system for reflecting privately on the things I read—for checking my understanding, for improving retention of information, and for identifying questions to follow up on. Two: it’s a system for making connections between ideas. Creativity is mostly a matter of combining things in unusual ways, and the slip-box is a playground designed specifically for that.</p><p>So, what is it? Essentially, it is an incubation chamber for two types of written documents.</p><ul><li><em>Literature notes</em> are paraphrases of ideas and arguments encountered during research, complete with references.</li><li><em>Permanent notes</em> are the notetaker’s ‘original’ thoughts.</li></ul><p>Both types of notes are written in publishable-quality prose, and each note is meant to include enough detail that it could be read and understood on its own. The magic starts once you have enough notes that you can start connecting them to each other, prompting the creation of even more notes.</p><p>The inventor of the slip-box method, the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, connected his notes manually with an intricate system of IDs. But now we have software that can manage connections for us. Enter <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, a new note-taking power-tool that early users are going absolutely bonkers over. I too have joined the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult">cult</a>. Roam is special for many reasons, one of which is that it’s a perfect platform for building a modern slip-box. (Roam’s founder, Conor White-Sullivan, was heavily influenced by Luhmann.)</p><p>Still, I haven’t yet seen any accounts of how to use Roam as a slip-box. Despite being new to both Roam and the slip-box method, I thought I’d share my current system.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with Roam, you should go read Nat Eliason’s <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love it and How I Use It</a>. If you want to learn more about the slip-box method, read Sönke Ahrens’ book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes">How to Take Smart Notes</a> or Yuxi Liu’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017">summary of it</a>.</p><h2 id="roam-as-a-slip-box">Roam as a slip-box</h2><p>When I first started experimenting with the slip-box method in Roam, I had three questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Where should I write my notes?</strong> Should each note be its own page, or its own block? How should I manage note metadata, if at all?</li><li><strong>How should I distinguish between types of notes?</strong> How should literature notes be categorized separately from permanent notes, and how should both of them be categorized separately from other uses of Roam?</li><li><strong>How should I connect my notes to each other?</strong> By inline page links, by sub-blocks, or something else?</li></ol><p>My answers to these questions are in three Roam features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Daily Notes pages.</strong> I write all my literature notes and permanent notes as individual blocks in my daily notes. This makes it easy to track when I wrote each note, and means that other notes or thoughts can be conveniently added in parallel without needing to bounce around between pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tags</strong>: I have a tag for literature notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#litnote</code>) and a tag for permanent notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#permnote</code>). I include these tags, as well as any relevant reference material, at the end of the relevant blocks. When I want to see all my literature notes or permanent notes together, I can go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">litnote</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permnote</code> pages and see them in the linked references.</p></li><li><p><strong>Block references</strong>: Roam allows inline links to other pages, but sometimes you don’t want to link a block to a whole page, but simply to another block. For this I use block references: by typing double parentheses and searching for the original block of interest, I can insert that block into my current block at any point and add whatever additional information I want to include in my new note.</p></li></ul><p>You can see me using all three of these features in my daily notes page from January 18th:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/roam_slipbox/roam_daily_note.png"/></p><p>I like this system because it makes many things easy. I can compose, categorize, connect, and track my notes all at the speed of thought, without being prevented from using Roam for other purposes.</p><p>Still, my system will surely keep evolving. I don’t consider myself a Roam poweruser, so if you are one and you have suggestions, please do send them my way.</p></div>'

Counterintuitively, the better you are at tidying up, the more you can delight in chaos.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>To go viral, go to all that trouble</h1><p>It seems like the key to making a creative project that goes viral is hard to execute but conceptually pretty simple: do something that makes people think “I can’t <em>believe</em> you went to all that trouble.” E.g. TikTok videos where people spend 12 hours trying to bounce a ping pong ball into a cup from across the room, then get 40 million views. You could do that! But you probably won’t, because, I mean…can you imagine going to all that trouble? Some specific examples:</p><ul><li>Alexey Guzey <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1195380402078265345">spent 130 hours</a> fact-checking Matthew Walker’s book “Why We Sleep”. (3300 likes on Twitter.)</li><li>My friend Ben spent 140 hours meticulously cutting out paper letters to tell the story of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgIkxAfJsk">the history of typography</a>. (1.5 million views on YouTube.)</li><li>My friend Matthew learned every single song on the piano and then performed them as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOM9vbB2nM8">medley</a>. (40,000 views on YouTube, then got to perform live with them!)</li><li>MrBeast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWcldHxHFpo">counted to 100,000</a> in one video. (20 million views on YouTube.)</li></ul><p>This is not to say that these people weren’t also demonstrating skill or exercising great judgment. It’s just that the virality is largely driven by the “can-you-imagine-going-to-all-that-trouble” factor. As Teller of the magician duo Penn &amp; Teller <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/teller-reveals-his-secrets-100744801/">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Make the secret a lot more trouble than the trick seems worth. You will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest. My partner, Penn, and I once produced 500 live cockroaches from a top hat on the desk of talk-show host David Letterman. To prepare this took weeks. We hired an entomologist who provided slow-moving, camera-friendly cockroaches (the kind from under your stove don’t hang around for close-ups) and taught us to pick the bugs up without screaming like preadolescent girls. Then we built a secret compartment out of foam-core (one of the few materials cockroaches can’t cling to) and worked out a devious routine for sneaking the compartment into the hat. More trouble than the trick was worth? To you, probably. But not to magicians.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, for many people who do things like this, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyj612/status/1256410576244420609">it doesn’t <em>feel</em> like trouble to them</a>. They’re just doing what they enjoy—another reason to <a class="internal-link" href="/maximize-pleasure/" id="maximize-pleasure">maximize pleasure</a>.</p></div>'
