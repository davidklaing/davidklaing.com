    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-06-24</em><hr/><p>This is a summary of Albert-László Barabási’s 2018 book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39088545-the-formula">The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success</a>. I generally steer clear of books with titles like this one, but Barabási is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">well-regarded network scientist</a>, so I thought he might have substantive ideas on what drives success. It turns out he does, and they are quite easy to summarize.</p><p>Generally, ‘success’ just means the achievement of a goal. But in this book, Barabási uses the word to mean something more specific: “the rewards we earn from the communities we belong to.” In particular, this type of success is distinct from performance, in that performance is about what you can do, whereas success is about how you are recognized for what you can do.</p><p>The book devotes one chapter to each of what Barabási calls the universal laws of success:</p><ol><li>Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success.</li><li>Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded.</li><li>Previous success x fitness = future success.</li><li>While team success requires diversity and balance, a single individual will receive credit for the group’s achievements.</li><li>With persistence success can come at any time.</li></ol><p>Barabási emphasizes that these laws are not recommendations per se, but rather they are claims about a phenomenon. They are meant to help us reason about how social status flows through networks and accrues to individuals within them. That being said, the laws have clear implications for what a person should do if they are seeking success, so after each law I share what I think those implications are.</p><h2 id="the-universal-laws-of-success">The universal laws of success</h2><h3 id="1-performance-drives-success-but-when-performance-cant-be-measured-networks-drive-success">1. Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success.</h3><p>In domains where performance is easy to measure, like in athletics or games, networks don’t count for much. If you can beat Magnus Carlsen at chess or beat Tiger Woods at golf, it doesn’t matter who you know; you’ll get plenty of recognition.</p><p>But in domains where performance is harder or even impossible to measure, like in the arts, in academics, and in most professions, performance only gets you so far. If you have ever seen a virtuosic street-performing musician and wondered why they weren’t world famous, it’s probably because music isn’t a game with strict rules and unambiguous scores. The harder it is to rank people directly by their skill or by the quality of their contributions, the more their differences in success will be caused by their network: who they know and how well they are liked.</p><h4 id="lessons">Lessons</h4><ul><li>In domains where performance is easy to measure, focus on improving your performance.</li><li>In domains where performance is hard to measure, focus on providing something of value to the relevant community.</li></ul><h3 id="2-performance-is-bounded-but-success-is-unbounded">2. Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded.</h3><p>Usain Bolt is only a few milliseconds faster than the second fastest sprinter in the world, but he is vastly more famous. Not only that, but Bolt is at most about 2x faster than me, and I’m just a random guy off the street. Mathematically, performance and success are different beasts: the former is about bell curves, while the latter is about long tails.</p><h4 id="lessons-1">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Hitting a plateau in performance does not imply hitting a plateau in success.</li><li>Unless you have the potential to be the best of the best performers, don’t seek success in domains where performance is easy to measure.</li></ul><h3 id="3-previous-success-x-fitness--future-success">3. Previous success x fitness = future success.</h3><p>In network dynamics, an individual’s ‘fitness’ is like their stickiness—how easily they retain the attention and positive regard of others who encounter them. At a conference, your fitness is defined by how good an impression you make during smalltalk at a poster session. On the internet, your fitness is defined by the appeal of your website or your profile—how you describe yourself, the visual style you project, and your recent activity.</p><p>Of course, fitness doesn’t count for much in the short term if you don’t encounter many people. The other factor that matters in predicting future success is how much success you have already achieved. In a 1999 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model">paper</a>, Barabási and his colleague Réka Albert coined the term <em>preferential attachment</em> to describe how wealth or credit ‘attaches’ itself to people according to how much they already have, causing a rich-get-richer effect. When you observe an individual’s rise to fame in a network, it often starts slow because the compounding effects of their fitness aren’t obvious until after many rounds of multiplication.</p><h4 id="lessons-2">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Be patient.</li><li>Increase your fitness.</li><li>Have as many encounters as possible, especially with influential nodes in your network.</li></ul><h3 id="4-while-team-success-requires-diversity-and-balance-a-single-individual-will-receive-credit-for-the-groups-achievements">4. While team success requires diversity and balance, a single individual will receive credit for the group’s achievements.</h3><p>The members of a team have a good understanding of who contributed what, but this information is usually inaccessible to outside observers. Observers will therefore assign credit using heuristics—giving it to, say, the person who is most vocal, or the most senior, or whose outputs were most visible, or whose past experience is most consistent with this type of work. Imagine if I were to study under Barabási and co-author a paper with him. Even if I did most of the work, the scientific community would think of it as Barabási’s new paper, not mine, because this would be their first time hearing my name.</p><h4 id="lessons-3">Lessons</h4><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/talk-more/" id="talk-more">Speak up.</a></li><li>Work on things that are visible.</li><li>Build a specific reputation for the thing you want to be recognized for.</li></ul><h3 id="5-with-persistence-success-can-come-at-any-time">5. With persistence success can come at any time.</h3><p>Success often results from breakthrough innovations and creative achievements, so people often speculate on the causes of such achievements. In particular, it is assumed that creativity is strongly related to a person’s age, and that it is at its peak during the early stages of their career. If you believe this, you might think that if you’re past your prime, you might as well not even try.</p><p>Barabási’s research suggests a different model: age predicts <em>productivity</em>, and productivity predicts creative success. In other words, each project completed has a similar probability of being a breakout hit, but because people tend to complete more projects early in their careers, this is when they most commonly achieve success. This means that there’s no reason to be fatalistic about having missed your opportunity; the key is to keep producing.</p><h4 id="lessons-4">Lessons</h4><ul><li>Keep producing good work.</li><li>Don’t second-guess yourself because of your age.</li></ul><h2 id="core-takeaways">Core takeaways</h2><p>To summarize the lessons from all of Barabási’s laws, the path to success is simple:</p><ul><li>Patiently produce a large volume of work in public.</li><li>Build relationships and provide value to your community.</li><li>Craft your image so that when people encounter you, they want to keep you in their circle.</li></ul></div>'

But I haven’t seen any that focus on long-term professional development. This is how I’m currently thinking about it.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-goal">What is the goal?</h2><p>In a sense, the goal is constant improvement, but not just so that you can make more money or pass a test. It’s about continuously breathing new life into your self-efficacy—giving yourself increasingly strong evidence that you can take on more responsibility and be more ambitious.</p><p>You’re lucky if you can get this evidence in an organic way through the work you’re already doing. But I have the impression that many data scientists, like me, eventually start to worry that certain skills are atrophying and that they are becoming over-specialized or complacent.</p><h2 id="what-should-you-focus-on">What should you focus on?</h2><p>If you want to continually increase your self-efficacy, I think there are four areas to focus on:</p><ol><li>Concepts</li><li>Skills</li><li>Tools</li><li>Resources</li></ol><p>My suggestion is that you should try not to neglect any one of these categories for too long. If you go a whole year without making an active effort to increase your conceptual understanding, something is probably missing. But at the same time, you don’t need to constantly work on them all in parallel. One or another might be more or less rewarding depending on your mood at a given time. Think of them like directions on a joystick.</p><h3 id="1-concepts">1. Concepts</h3><p>Concepts are about what you know. Think:</p><ul><li>Bias-variance tradeoff</li><li>Central limit theorem</li><li>Curse of dimensionality</li><li>Bayes’ theorem</li></ul><p>Ideally, you are constantly deepening your knowledge of fundamental concepts, and branching out to new ones that interest you. Some people do this by regularly reading papers or textbooks that force them to call fundamentals to mind. It’s a good approach (much better than nothing!), but for me it lacks something crucial: testing yourself explicitly on your understanding.</p><p>I see two main ways to test yourself. One is through a spaced repetition practice, using software like Anki to help you stay sharp. The other is communication: explaining concepts to others through writing or speaking. I’m especially excited by the prospect of evergreen note-taking as a practice for engaging more deeply with data science concepts. If you haven’t heard of this idea, check out Andy Matuschak’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C">notes</a> on it.</p><h3 id="2-skills">2. Skills</h3><p>Skills are about what you can do. Think:</p><ul><li>Wrangle data</li><li>Run statistical tests</li><li>Write software packages</li><li>Create data visualizations</li><li>Train and validate models</li></ul><p>Again, the idea is constantly go deeper on fundamental skills and go broader on ones that interest you.</p><p>I see two main approaches to improving skills. One is to work on projects—ideally ones that are meaningful to you. The other is to regularly work through targeted exercises, like on Project Euler or Brilliant. The key is that you’re <em>doing</em> something.</p><p>When developing skills, it’s also worth asking whether targeted practice might be a bit overrated relative to the pursuit of tacit knowledge—the kind of know-how that can’t be (or isn’t) expressed in words. Cedric Chin has a great series of essays on this: https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/</p><h3 id="3-tools">3. Tools</h3><p>Tools are about what you use to do the things you do. Think:</p><ul><li>Specific programming languages</li><li>Packages</li><li>IDEs</li></ul><p>It’s hard to say whether there even <em>are</em> fundamentals when it comes to tools, since they change year by year. But you shouldn’t ignore them. There’s overlap here with concepts and skills—e.g. becoming a better Python programmer involves both learning new Python concepts and writing more Python code. So you can use spaced repetition, communication, projects, or targeted exercises. The key is to not neglect your tools as a subject of your learning.</p><h3 id="4-resources">4. Resources</h3><p>Resources are about what you reference when you haven’t stored important information in your brain. Think:</p><ul><li>Textbooks</li><li>Online courses</li><li>Cheatsheets</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>Wikis</li></ul><p>The goal here is to build yourself a “second brain”, to borrow Tiago Forte’s phrase. Improving your familiarity with data science resources is probably the easiest way to improve your professional self-efficacy, because it requires little effort but is a force multiplier for your efforts in learning about concepts, skills, and tools. Essentially, you want to build yourself a central repository of the best resources on every relevant topic, so that you always know where to go to find information that you haven’t memorized or to refresh your understanding on material that you feel rusty on.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>To go viral, go to all that trouble</h1><p>It seems like the key to making a creative project that goes viral is hard to execute but conceptually pretty simple: do something that makes people think “I can’t <em>believe</em> you went to all that trouble.” E.g. TikTok videos where people spend 12 hours trying to bounce a ping pong ball into a cup from across the room, then get 40 million views. You could do that! But you probably won’t, because, I mean…can you imagine going to all that trouble? Some specific examples:</p><ul><li>Alexey Guzey <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1195380402078265345">spent 130 hours</a> fact-checking Matthew Walker’s book “Why We Sleep”. (3300 likes on Twitter.)</li><li>My friend Ben spent 140 hours meticulously cutting out paper letters to tell the story of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgIkxAfJsk">the history of typography</a>. (1.5 million views on YouTube.)</li><li>My friend Matthew learned every single song on the piano and then performed them as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOM9vbB2nM8">medley</a>. (40,000 views on YouTube, then got to perform live with them!)</li><li>MrBeast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWcldHxHFpo">counted to 100,000</a> in one video. (20 million views on YouTube.)</li></ul><p>This is not to say that these people weren’t also demonstrating skill or exercising great judgment. It’s just that the virality is largely driven by the “can-you-imagine-going-to-all-that-trouble” factor. As Teller of the magician duo Penn &amp; Teller <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/teller-reveals-his-secrets-100744801/">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Make the secret a lot more trouble than the trick seems worth. You will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest. My partner, Penn, and I once produced 500 live cockroaches from a top hat on the desk of talk-show host David Letterman. To prepare this took weeks. We hired an entomologist who provided slow-moving, camera-friendly cockroaches (the kind from under your stove don’t hang around for close-ups) and taught us to pick the bugs up without screaming like preadolescent girls. Then we built a secret compartment out of foam-core (one of the few materials cockroaches can’t cling to) and worked out a devious routine for sneaking the compartment into the hat. More trouble than the trick was worth? To you, probably. But not to magicians.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, for many people who do things like this, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyj612/status/1256410576244420609">it doesn’t <em>feel</em> like trouble to them</a>. They’re just doing what they enjoy—another reason to <a class="internal-link" href="/maximize-pleasure/" id="maximize-pleasure">maximize pleasure</a>.</p></div>'
