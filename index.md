Welcome! I'm <a id="about-me" class="internal-link" href="/about-me/">David Laing</a>. I maintain this website as a way to share my learning, to give more life to ideas that I think are underappreciated, and to make it easier for my future friends to find me. If you think you might be one of them, please say hello on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing">Twitter</a>.
