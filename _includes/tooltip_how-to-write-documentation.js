He explains it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg">his talk at PyCon Australia 2017</a>, and in a <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">standalone website</a>.</p><p>The basic idea is that there isn’t just a single kind of documentation—there are four:</p><ol><li>Tutorials</li><li>How-to guides</li><li>Reference guides</li><li>Discussions</li></ol><p>Each serves a different purpose and has its own stylistic considerations.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/documentation/four_forms_of_documentation.png"/></p><hr><h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2><p>Tutorials are learning-focused.</p><p>They take the form of a lesson, and are meant to help a beginner get started with an activity. They should inspire confidence, include lots of activities, and minimize distractions.</p><p>Food analogy: teaching a child how to cook.</p><h2 id="how-to-guides">How-to guides</h2><p>How-to guides are problem-focused.</p><p>They take the form of a series of steps, and are meant to help the reader solve a specific problem (often one that a beginner wouldn’t even know how to formulate). They should be focused and algorithmic.</p><p>Food analogy: a recipe in a cookbook.</p><h2 id="reference-guides">Reference guides</h2><p>Reference guides are information-focused.</p><p>They take the form of dry description, and are meant purely to “describe the machinery”. They should accurate, up-to-date, and structurally and tonally consistent.</p><p>Food analogy: an encyclopedia article about an ingredient.</p><h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2><p>Discussions are understanding-focused.</p><p>They take the form of a discursive explanation, and are meant to help the reader understand a concept, a philosophy, or a history. They should provide context, and avoid instruction.</p><p>Food analogy: an article on culinary social history.</p><hr/><p>Documentation is useful to the extent that all four forms are both <em>present</em> and <em>separate</em>.</p><p>As soon as they start to bleed into each other, the documentation becomes a rat’s nest—hard for readers to navigate, and hard for authors to maintain. The temptation to blend them is explained in this amazing 2x2:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/documentation/quadrant_annotated.png"/></p><ul><li>Tutorials and how-to guides are practical, while discussions and references are theoretical.</li><li>Tutorials and discussions are useful when studying, while how-to guides and references are useful when coding.</li></ul><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li>Procida, Daniele.
